"Planetwise Flannel Wipes","These flannel wipes are OK, but in my opinion not worth keeping.  I also ordered someImse Vimse Cloth Wipes-Ocean Blue-12 countwhich are larger, had a nicer, softer texture and just seemed higher quality.  I use cloth wipes for hands and faces and have been usingThirsties 6 Pack Fab Wipes, Boyfor about 8 months now and need to replace them because they are starting to get rough and have had stink issues for a while that stripping no longer handles.",3
"Planetwise Wipe Pouch","it came early and was not disappointed. i love planet wise bags and now my wipe holder. it keps my osocozy wipes moist and does not leak. highly recommend it.",5

"Stop Pacifier Sucking without tears with Thumbuddy To Love\'s Binky Fairy Puppet and Adorable Book","This is a product well worth the purchase.  I have not found anything else like this, and it is a positive, ingenious approach to losing the binky.  What I love most about this product is how much ownership my daughter has in getting rid of the binky.  She is so proud of herself, and loves her little fairy.  I love the artwork, the chart in the back, and the clever approach of this tool.",5
"Stop Pacifier Sucking without tears with Thumbuddy To Love\'s Binky Fairy Puppet and Adorable Book","All of my kids have cried non-stop when I tried to ween them off their pacifier, until I found Thumbuddy To Love\'s Binky Fairy Puppet.  It is an easy way to work with your kids to allow them to understand where their pacifier is going and help them part from it.This is a must buy book, and a great gift for expecting parents!!  You will save them soo many headaches.Thanks for this book!  You all rock!!",5
"Stop Pacifier Sucking without tears with Thumbuddy To Love\'s Binky Fairy Puppet and Adorable Book","When the Binky Fairy came to our house, we didn\'t have any special gift and book to help explain to her about how important it is to stop using a pacifier. This book does a great job to help prepare your child for the loss of their favorite item. The doll is adorable and we made lots of cute movies with the Binky Fairy telling our daughter about what happens when the Binky Fairy comes. I would highly recommend this product for any parent trying to break the pacifier or thumb sucking habit.",5
"A Tale of Baby\'s Days with Peter Rabbit","Lovely book, it\'s bound tightly so you may not be able to add alot of photos/cards aside from the designated spaces in the book. Shop around before you purchase, as it is currently listed at Barnes & Noble for 29.95!",4
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","Perfect for new parents. We were able to keep track of baby\'s feeding, sleep and diaper change schedule for the first two and a half months of her life. Made life easier when the doctor would ask questions about habits because we had it all right there!",5
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","A friend of mine pinned this product on Pinterest so I decided to give it a whirl! It is fantastic! If you are a new parent, this will help you keep track of feedings, diaper changes and the like!",5
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","This has been an easy way for my nanny to record all the key events that happen with my baby when I\'m not at home.  Would highly recommend it to someone who wants to stay informed of what your baby is up to while you\'re not home.The only reason this isn\'t a 5 is because I think there could have been some more standarad pre-printed options.I plan on ordering another one when we run out of pages in this journal.",4
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","I love this journal and our nanny uses it everyday to track on our daughter\'s sleep, eating and other activities. The layout and design make it very easy to fill in quickly with a comments column to add in details (i.e. we ask the nanny to specify what food she had for lunch, amount of milk she took, specifics of play time--tummy time, walk to park, etc.) I love knowing the details of my baby\'s day, and I also use it to track weekly on overall schedule patterns and changes (i.e. baby\'s nap time has moved naturally as she gets older).My only complaint is that there is no real space to communicate back to the nanny, as I sometimes want to reply to the nanny\'s comments and/or leave her notes about the previous night (i.e. Baby didn\'t sleep well or baby has rash, etc) or other instructions (Please use sun screen on the baby - it\'s hot out today) that I often forget to tell her in the rush of the morning. I just stick in post-its now for my notes. All in all, I highly recommend this baby tracker.",4
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","This book is perfect!  I\'m a first time new mom, and this book made it so easy to keep track of feedings, diaper changes, sleep.  Definitely would recommend this for new moms.  Plus it\'s small enough that I throw in the diaper back for doctor visits.",5
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","I originally just gave the nanny a pad of paper to write down this information for my little one. She would take him to the park and leave the pad behind - I was getting incomplete/inaccurate information when she wohld get home at the end of the day and try to remember naps/feedings/diaper changes. I wanted something she could take with her and also a way to better control how she reported information. This was the perfect solution! Now I\'m getting all the information I wanted. There is a very helpful example of how to fill it out. It also has a pouch for additional documents and a section up front for emergency contact info. Each page goes from 7 - 6. This works for me because the nanny starts at 7am and ends before 6pm. I use an app on my phone for tracking when I\'m with the baby. I transfer the info from this notebook to my phone. My only complaint: the space is pretty small - they provide useful shorthand, but it\'s a little difficult to fit some of the info in the space provided. Also, some of the other reviews complain about the 7 - 6 time format. This isn\'t a real problem for me, but I suppose if you wanted to track an entire day, you would have to use two pages - not too big of a deal. 7am - 6pm is pretty much perfect for daycare/nanny/caregiver situation.",4
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","I thought keeping a simple handwritten journal would be nice.  But I haven\'t used this thing at all, and here\'s why:1.) When you\'re breastfeeding, it\'s often nice to have your phone close by so that you can keep yourself entertained.  If you are able to grab *both* your phone and this notebook - and a pen - consistently - and at 3 in the morning - you are more skilled than me.  (I don\'t nurse in the same place every time.)2.) You\'re also often so sleep deprived that - at least for me - I\'d forget to look at what time we started on a side, or what side we started on.  I\'m not perfect with the app I have either, but at least I just have to mindlessly hit a button.3.) I really like the app I have (Baby Connect).  It gives me better data.  For example, it can tell me how long on average feedings have been taking (helpful as we start to think about sleep training).  It can tell me that I nursed him 177 times last month (granted that serves no useful purpose other than a feeling of perverse satisfaction).",3
"Nature\'s Lullabies First Year Sticker Calendar","Space for monthly photos, info and a lot of useful stickers come with it. It is exactly what I wanted!!",5
"Nature\'s Lullabies First Year Sticker Calendar","I bought this calender for myself for my second son. It is very colorful and has room on each page to write height, weight, and what baby likes to do. There is also room on each page for a photo to be placed. The calender date boxes have room for a sticker and some fine writing. My only complaint is that it does not have as many stickers as I would like, but I just put asterisks before whatever special event happened that day. I bought one for a friend as she found it very useful as well.",4
"Nature\'s Lullabies First Year Sticker Calendar","I love this little calender, you can keep track of all of baby\'s firsts. I like the illustrations, and the stickers too.",5
"Nature\'s Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar","This was the only calender I could find for the second year. I did one for the first and wanted to continue cause there are so many things to note still after they turn 1. This one was better than the first year one I got him.",5
"Nature\'s Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar","I completed a calendar for my son\'s first year and really enjoyed tracking all of his milestones and special moments - so much so that I wanted to continue in the second year since he\'s still doing amazing and fun things every day.  I really like the simple layout of the calendar and while it might not have all the questions and milestone stickers you want - at least it\'s something to keep recording all those special moments!",4
"Nature\'s Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar","We wanted to get something to keep track of our child\'s milestones and this is a cute option. There aren\'t many other choices out there and this does exactly what we wanted.",5
"Nature\'s Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar","I had a hard time finding a second year calendar, this is the only one I came across and it is great!  Large enough to write in the squares and has a spot to put that month\'s picture in as well as some memories. The first two years they change so much I like to jot everything down so I can keep track of all the big milestones...and little ones!  I find it is easier to do this on a calendar vs a baby book.  This way you can fill out the baby book later and have a great reference to do so!",5
"Nature\'s Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar","I only purchased a second-year calendar for my son because I had one for my daughter. I was really disappointed with the lack of selection available for second-year calendars in general, so I just got this one because it was one of the only ones. It\'s an okay calendar. The finish on the pages is glossy which makes it hard to write on with certain pens. The stickers aren\'t very cute and the pages are pretty old-fashioned looking. Hopefully they will come out with some other calendars for future purchasers.",2
"Nature\'s Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar","I LOVE this calendar for recording events of my son\'s second year of life.  There are plenty of 1st year baby calendars out there and I loved reocording events of his first year and didn\'t want to just stop now that he is one.  Nature\'s lullabies second year calendar is perfect for continuing on with daily record keeping.  The stickers are wonderful and helped me think of milestones to record that I might not have thought of on my own.  I highly recommend this calendar!  Plus it\'s super cute and brat for either gender.",5
"Nature\'s Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar","Calendar is exactly as described, but I find the look of it to be very cheap.  There are lots of nice stickers to use.  I was just disappointed it looks so cheap.",3
"Nature\'s Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar","Wife loves this calender. Comes with a lot of stickers and options to mark the firsts. Includes spaces for milestone photos as well. Sticker borders for photos, etc, it is just a very easy to use scrap booking option. Especially for new moms who dont have enough time to actually sit down, and haul out a ton of scrapbook supplies",5
"Nature\'s Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar","My daughter had her 1st baby over a year ago. She did receive and fill up a First Year Calendar. When her son was nearing his first birthday she was looking for a Second Year Calendar to record his milestones. Thanks to Amazon I was able to get this for her and she LOVES it. Tender sweet art work - helpful stickers - unique pages to fill. A nice keepsake. A wonderful gift for a one-year old!",5
"Baby\'s First Journal - Green","Extremely useful! As a new mom, tired and inexpedient, not remembering how long ago baby ate, this definitely helped me through the first two months.",5
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","My son loves peek a boo at this age of 9 months so I thought this book would be perfect! This book doesn\'t engage him enough though it seems.  He does however like the cover the most if I make pretend blow-kisses and peekaboo gestures with the hands and show him. He also likes when I fan the hair towards his face.Maybe when he\'s older he will flip the flaps but right now he just likes the mirror at the end and the front cover. If I flip the book through he just takes the book and shakes it around.",3
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","One of baby\'s first and favorite books, and it is washable! I gave 1 less star than perfect because I\'d like to see some diversity in the people - not just your typical white family ;)",4
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","I like how the book has a hook to attach it to your stroller or car seat - it wont get lost.  Great way to go over family members.",5
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","Beautiful little book.  A great little short story saying I Love You....Keeps the attention of the baby and then the baby can actually turn the pages and hold on to it when you are finished interacting with it.",5
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","This book is so worth the money. It says 9+ months on the box but I can\'t wait for my baby to be born to try to use it before. It\'s so cute and very interactive! There are flaps to open on every page.",5
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","we just got this book for our one-year-old and she loves it.  It\'s so nice that she can\'t bite chunks out of it like she can a board book or rip it like a paper one.  She can chew on it, pull on it, and carry it all over the house!  She loves the little flaps that open and is learning simple words like ""daddy,"" ""mommy,"" ""puppy,"" etc.  We love it.",5
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","The book is colorful and is perfect for 6months and older. The only thing I didn\'t like was the strong smell of the dyes and/or material. I dunked the pages in detergent. Then let the book dry overnight.",4
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","The book is cute, and we are huge fans of Lamaze products, however, this one leaves out some family members (no little brother) and can possibly cause hurt feelings. That said, our baby loves to play with the hands, hair and flaps!",3
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","What a great book for babies!  I\'d been looking for books which couldn\'t be damaged by my 10-month old\'s drool...so cloth or plastic books were my options.  This book adds another level to your usual cloth book--a fun flap or moving part on every page.  This interactive book is perfect for my baby!",5
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","My son loved this book as an infant.  It was perfect because he would chew on his board books and destroy them, but this one we didn\'t have that issue.  I love the Lamaze series, they are a lot of fun not only for the child but for the parent.I liked that this book was not only teaching my son about Peek a Boo, but we used it to learn names for family members like grandparents, sister, cat, dog etc.  And of course with it being a lift the flap book, that was additional fun for my son as well.  He\'s nearly two now and he doesn\'t look at it as much, but he still does enjoy reading it and playing with it now and again.  I\'d say out of all the Lamaze books, this one and Discovery Farm are his favorites.",5
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","Our baby loves this book & has loved it for a while now ... He enjoys when I read it to him, and enjoys playing with it on his own.",5
"SoftPlay Twinkle Twinkle Elmo A Bedtime Book","",5
"SoftPlay Twinkle Twinkle Elmo A Bedtime Book","My son likes brushing elmo\'s teeth. Almost too nice of a book to let the kids play with haha :)",5
"SoftPlay Twinkle Twinkle Elmo A Bedtime Book","This was a birthday present for my 2 year old grandchildren.  They love this book and will sit and go through it page by page themselves .  The pictures are imaginative and appeal to young children.  Would buy it again!",5
"SoftPlay Giggle Jiggle Funbook, Happy Bear","This bear is absolutely adorable and I would give it a 5 star rating if it actually giggled or growled like it was suppose to!  I just got it in the mail the other day and was super excited when I saw how cute it was!  If it\'s something as simple as a dead battery I could handle it BUT I can\'t even find a place where the batteries would to!  Such a disappointment....it\'s going back and I have no gift to take down to my new Granddaughter, Kenzie, now!",2
"SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where\'s Elmo A Children\'s Book","My baby absolutely loves Elmo and so this book seemed perfect for her.  I\'m happy to say I was right:  this book is nice and soft and beautifully illustrated so my little one takes it everywhere and ""reads"" it all of the time. While Elmo is the main character of because he hides on each page, other Sesame Street characters are also featured which is fun, too. Another great, interactive, Elmo centric book that I would recommend for the Sesame Street/Elmo lovers is ""Twinkle, Twinkle Elmo"" (which is also available on Amazon for a great price).",5
"SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where\'s Elmo A Children\'s Book","I bought two for recent baby showers!  The book is soft and interactive, great for any baby, and the bright colors are beautiful.  Lastly, who doesn\'t love Elmo!",5
"SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where\'s Elmo A Children\'s Book","We wanted to get another book like the Big Birds Friends softplay book, and we only found the two Elmo books. This one is fun, but the Big Bird book has more variety and is more creative.",4
"SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where\'s Elmo A Children\'s Book","This is a cute little peek-a-boo story book.  It\'s soft.  It\'s safe.  And it is easy for baby to handle.",4
"SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where\'s Elmo A Children\'s Book","My 3 month old son loves this book. We read it over and over and he smiles and laughs every time we find Elmo and say &#34;peekaboo Elmo!&#34;  We have a few different soft books and this is the most colorful and fun to read. And baby adores it, so 5 stars for sure.",5
"SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where\'s Elmo A Children\'s Book","Very cute interactive book! My son loves this book! The bright colorful illustrations make this great for babies & toddlers.",5
"SoftPlay 4 Pack Block Book, Sweet Sesame","Bought for granddauchildren and they play with them all the time.  Love reading to them.  Soft, so if they fall on them, they are safe. When they use the Elmo book, the kiss Elmo.  Got when they were 9 mos, now they are two and we are still having fun with them.  They love to see how high they can stack the blocks before it falls over.  I buy as a baby present.",5
"SoftPlay 4 Pack Block Book, Sweet Sesame","I have teething babies and these were great for entertaining the, and letting them chew and droll all over the, without worrying about ruining them. They were great for setting them off to their side to encourage rolling over and crawling. Great Christmas gift for the younger baby and didn\'t break the bank.",4
"SoftPlay Cloth Book, Love","This book is boring. Nothing to stimulate my granddaughter. It is a waste of money. I would not recommend it",1
"SoftPlay Baby\'s First Cloth Books Gift Set","It is so hard to find cloth books with ACTUAL images on them! So many have unrealistic portrayals of what animals/objects look like, but this one is fantastic. EXACTLY what we were looking for!!When we teach our 1 year old what a ""lion"" is, we want to show him a REAL lion... not a drawing that looks nothing like a real lion.",5
"SoftPlay Cloth Book, Hugs","for the young child, very cute...so happy they can &#34; read&#34; something there is little or no chance of them destroying..many happy reading memories",5
"SoftPlay Baby Animals of the World Soft Cloth Book","not bad but not as interesting to my 1-year old as I thought. Mot interactive [texture, etc] but cute anyway",3

"Baby\'s First Year Undated Wall Calendar with Stickers to Mark &quot;Firsts&quot; - Pink","Quick and Easy to keep up with all the first milestones of a little one, especially for a busy, first-time Mom.",5
"Baby\'s First Year Undated Wall Calendar with Stickers to Mark &quot;Firsts&quot; - Pink","I searched high and low for a first year calendar and settled on this one based on the reviews.  I am so happy that I did.  Perfect for jotting down quick memories throughout the month and remembering dates of baby\'s &#34;firsts&#34;.  Will be fun to look back on.  Also has spots for personalization and pictures.",5
"Baby\'s First Year Undated Wall Calendar with Stickers to Mark &quot;Firsts&quot; - Pink","This is a very good gift for a new mother.  You would want to give it to the parents as soon as baby is born so that they can start from the very beginning to chart the &#34;firsts&#34;.  I had one of these calendars for each of my five children.  They enjoy looking up their &#34;firsts&#34; especially as they are now parents themselves.",5

"Our Baby Girl Memory Book","Absolutely love it and all of the Scripture in it.  I purchased the Baby Boy version for my grandson when he was born and my daughter-in-law was thrilled to receive the same book again.",5
"Our Baby Girl Memory Book","Bought as a gift for my daughter in law. She loved it. Simple but a place to put important memories down. I loved the verses at bottom of pages.",4
"Our Baby Girl Memory Book","I didn\'t realize this was a religious product, so I almost returned it.  (Not that I have anything against that, but some of the pages ask for favorite scripture, prayers for the baby, etc.). Wasn\'t sure that fir with out lifestyle, but the book has all the right ages for memories, so we are keeping it.",3
"Our Baby Girl Memory Book","OMG.....we loved this baby book! Perfect for the memories you want to remember when your little one gets bigger and starts asking questions. It even had a place for foot and hand prints for when your baby is born which is the main reason why we liked this one. Also it has pockets for keepsakes and little places to put first locks of hair....etc! So cute and is a great baby shower gift!",5
"Our Baby Girl Memory Book","Beautiful book, I love it to record cherished times in my great granddaughters life with the beautiful pastel pink color.",5

"My Kindergarten Year - A Keepsake Book","I was pleasantly surprised upon receiving the memory book entitled,  ""My Kindergarten Year"". It is the perfect way to record one\'s Kindergarten experience through photographs and detailed descriptions of this very important time in your child\'s life. The questions are fun for your child to answer and record while serving its purpose for the parent.I\'d recommend this book to everyone with a Kindergartener.",5
"My Kindergarten Year - A Keepsake Book","I\'m so glad I stumbled upon these gem. My son has already started answering questions and I think it will be a great memory to look back years later to see how he answered the questions.",5
"Jellycat Elephant and Mouse Book","The book is just a few pages long with a few words to each page.  Just short enough to keep the attention of my 6 month old son.  We have the Elephant as well so when he\'s older it will be neat to see the realization of the association between the stuffed toy and the book character",4

"Modern House Winnie the Pooh Swing and Tiger Swing (2 pages) removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal","I could not get these Winnie the Pooh themed wall decor stickers in New Zealand and these were a very cost effective option that I was very impressed with.  They were easy to stick on and look fantastic on the wall - they don\'t &#34;look&#34; like stickers at all.  Very professional and very seamless on the paintwork.",5

"Reusable Flannel (15) Baby Wipes 100% Cotton Bleached and Unbleached (Flushable Diaper Liners)","I love these wipes.  They are so simple and soft and they are a great price for reusable wipes.  They actually get my baby clean and dry during diaper changes.  And I know that I\'ll find a million other uses for them after our diaper days are done.  I\'m ordering more of them right now!",5

"Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black)","We bought the pins as my 6 year old Autistic son was able to open or break open normal safety pins we needed to use for his night time clothes.  These new pins are significantly more sturdy and he hasn\'t learned how to open them and only once has he broken one open.  I seem to recall that their shipping price was more than a bit on the high side of reasonable though given the size of the package...",4

"Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black)","These diaper pins went to Honduras to hold the cloth diapers we also sent with the missionaries.

"Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black)","It has been many years since we needed diaper pins, but I do like to pin my socks together through the wash and have never lost one yet. I was using brass dressmaker pins but they tended to open up during the wash cycle. My wife suggested diaper pins and we tried them. Thery\'re working perfectly and staying together through the washing. Matter of fact they can get a little tricky to open, but of course that was the idea. Recommended to keep your socks &#34;friended up&#34;.",5
"Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black)","As another reviewer noted, these are great for matching socks before washing.  Now once the socks come out of the washer, I hang them to dry with the pins still on.  The socks stay on the line to dry without clothespins, they just hang with one sock on each side of the line.  After they are dried, I just open the pin and leave it by the hamper on a shelf.  As I put dirty socks into the hamper, I grab a pin and use it.  Has saved a lot of time and I don\'t have the problem of lost socks or mismatched socks on my feet.  Great idea and am glad I read about this here on the reviews.  Wish I had done this my whole life.",5

"Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black)","I really thought I was getting a dozen pins..turns out I should have counted the pins in the picture..as there are only 10.

"Wall-stickers Wall Decor Removable Decal Sticker - Giant Cherry Blossom Tree in Wind","I am pleased with the design I just wish the actual picture was bigger an putting it together doesn\'t make sense the numbers aligned with the branches don\'t make any sense compared to the picture they give you as an instruction -- you have to sort of free hand. I had to start it half way up my wall so it made a difference an could actually be seen -- as far as it hold up I put it up about 2 weeks ago an it had not peeled off at all.",3

When I got it the back is NOT STICKY at all!  Every time I walked into the bedroom I was picking up pieces off of the floor!  Very very frustrating!

"Blessed By Pope Francis Franciscan Knotted Our Lady of Grace Italian Made Aurora Borealis Crystal Rosary","I ordered this Rosary for a friend because it looked lovely in the photo and it is blessed by Pope Francis.  I was not disappointed as it is just beautiful, made with crystal, and knotted in between the Our Fathers.  I am giving this to my friend along with a copy of the novena of Our Lady Untier (or Undoer) of Knots, for whom Pope Francis has a strong devotion.  I definitely recommend this Rosary and would buy it again in a heart beat.",5

"Musical Christmas Nativity Scene Angel with Baby Jesus in a Rustic Barkwood Resin Manger 8&quot; Tall","I was so excited to get this nativity.  I have been watching it for months and I finally had an excuse to spend $25.00.  It is beautiful and I am very happy with the look of the item.  I am not so happy about the music box.  The song is WAY too fast and it had to play it through once to even recognize the song.  I don\'t know if there is a way to slow down a music box; if there is I wish someone would tell me.  I still love the nativity but I am not as excited as I would be if the music had been right.Buyer beware... beautiful nativity; not so great music",3
"Semanario (7) Little Girls 14k Gold Overlay Bangle Bracelets for Your Little Princess Sizes 1 - 4 (Size 2 - ages 9-24 Months)",". I am pleased with product. I love the bangles however they are a bit small. Had to slid them on with lotion. I like a snug fitting bangle but whew these were tough to get on!! If my hand was a hair bigger they wouldn\'t have fit. They are on to stay. I have small hands also. I got the size for large kid small adult and they fit wrist but tough over the hand. Overall satisfied with product and fast shipping!",4

"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","We used this to help us keep track of pees and poops during that first month. It is really helpful if you breastfeed to keep track of feeding patterns and wet diapers to make sure baby is eating enough. Great book!",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","This book is going to be a life saver! We are adopting and when we travel complete the adoption, I needed a book to keep track of baby\'s schedule. I have a terrible memory and this book will be perfect for keeping track of baby\'s schedule. I also love how there is a spot at the beginning for emergency numbers and important info. Perfect for traveling, the babysitter or just for at home use. I will definitely be buying more after I fill this up.",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","Love it love it love it!!  Got my first baby tracker as a gift, bought another one as soon as it was used up.  Great for daycare, too, so you can communicate with your provider about baby\'s activities for the day.  Also great for round the clock care- no need to ""remember"" when baby ate last or how much sleep you really got!!  Get it for your new moms- to- be!!",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","Of course this has been a great/easy way for me to record all of my baby\'s routines and a simple way for his caregiver to let me know how the day went.  What I really love about it, though, is that it was so easy for me to jot down all of his major milestones as they happened.  I knew that I wouldn\'t have time to work on his baby book in the beginning (and sure enough I didn\'t even get it out until after 2 months), and because I had this book I was able to finally transfer everything over.  Life saver!!  All of the funny little things would probably have been forgotten!",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","I am 4 weeks from delivery of my first baby and was looking for a newborn tracker. From the reviews I read this one looked like it had everything that one needs to write down and remember, so I bought it. I have not used it but I am very happy with what I saw. Hope it ends up being as useful at it looks.",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","We found this book at a rummage sale and found it to be so useful, especially when several people are helping with the baby (ex: visiting family, etc.)  We loved it so much that I\'ve bought another one and have almost filled that one too.  I like having the room to write things about our baby\'s day and development, plus use the ""Notes"" section to write some story, etc.  It also helps ""Dad"" see what has happened that day and feels more connected.  I will be buying another one soon!",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","I got this baby tracker as part of the \'new parents\' package from my work.

I am getting this for all my expecting friends! 5 starts!",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","I\'m a new mom and I was looking for something to record my baby\'s daily activities and patterns and it is perfect! It has a lot of space to write down anything extra beyond the diaper changes, feedings and sleeping. I like that it has an area to write down medications. It is a great reminder for dr appointments and to track your baby\'s patterns. I am extremely happy with this book and will be ordering another one for when I run out of pages in 3 months.",5

"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","I used a tracker with my first son - but I didn\'t so much need to with my second.  This tracker though, is laid out very well and keeps things pretty organized.  My only complaint is that it is not a full year tracker - I did the whole first year with my first son which is nice to refer back to.  I would recommend this book, but if you\'re interested in tracking the whole first year you will need to buy 3 (they run 4 months long).",4
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","This is the best way to keep track of when your baby eats, sleeps, poops, gets a bath, etc. It\'s also a great way to keep track of which side baby nursed on. I took this to all infant doc appt. And it\'s a great gift!",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","I rarely write a review however, this journal has been a lifesaver.  Sleep deprivation can compromise anyones ability to recall feeding and napping times, which breast was last used, soiled diapers, etc.. I even sleep with my journal to keep it close by so I can document around the clock.  The layout of this journal is very simple and easy to use at a quick glance.  I understand there are phone apps that do the same thing however, I chose this journal to allow my husband and nanny to have access to the information.  A must have and will make a great gift.",5

"Large Jungle Animals (Panda, Lion, Elephant, Gorilla) - 3D Wall Murals for Baby Nursery and Kids Rooms - Made in USA","I ordered these for my 7 month old sons play area.  They are very cool.  I love the fact that they can be removed from the wall and moved to a room or house if needed.  I would get these instead of wall decals because they are 1. easier to put up and 2. can be moved without ruining them.  It makes his play area look really cool!",5

"Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge","My daughter started playing with her Music Blocks set when she was just a few months old.  She spent hours entertaining herself.  She is now 18 months old and still loves this toy.  Now she understands how to arrange the blocks and has great fun making new musical patterns.  I highly recommend the Jumpin\' Jive Jazz cartridge -- it\'s her favorite -- and the Bach cartridge when you want calmer music.",5
"Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge","It takes a youthful spirit of inquiry and fascination to play with blocks and pre-programmed music. Anyone too old to play with blocks (or to young to play with them again) may back off. But they\'re missing a revolution in interactive toys. Each colored block represents part of a musical score, and each side on the block represents one way of delivering that piece, such as horn, violin, or voice. Turning and swapping blocks thus generates changes in the music played, with incredible variety. You (and, oh yes, the child too) will run out of steam long before you run out of interest. And the use of additional block sets expands the use and interest even more. Bravo!!",5
"Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge","This was one of my favorite toys-but beware if you buy this I went through 3 of these- and the company no longer exists-so if there is a problem with it-you are out of luck",3
"Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge","Our whole family loved the Mozart music blocks. I even bought another &quot;disk&quot; of music. Unfortunately, it was a constant challenge to keep the kids from destroying the delicate &quot;chip&quot; that was easily accessible. Finally it broke and I felt it was too expensive to replace. I feel that a toy at this price should be more durable. My suggestion would be to hide the &quot;plug in chip&quot; so that the kids aren\'t attracted to it. We have a 3-year old and a one-year old. The toy lasted about 6 months.",4
"Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge","This is an interesting and educational toy.  I got it for my 2 year old, and while she loved mixing up the blocks, she also loved pulling out the cartridge and couldn\'t put it back in.  That means I had to go put the cartridge back every 5 minutes.  If the cartridge were placed on the side or back, I don\'t think the littler ones would be so inclined to pull it...out of sight out of mind.",4
"Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge","Great idea, but the toy IS NOT durable.  After returning one toy for not working, another one has broken.  What a disappointment!!  And the customer service is non-existant and when it is, they are rude!!!! Someone let me know when the class-action lawsuit will occur.",1
"Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge","I bought this 18 months ago for my 6 year old and 2 year old.  They both loved it.  I bought additional cartridges then it stopped working.  We replaced the batteries twice and it still does not work.  It was expensive for a toy that did not last very long.",4
"Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge","I spent [a lot of money] when this thing first came out, and it worked TERRIBLY!  I sent it back to the company because it was defective and wouln\'t shut up.  They sent me another one.  It worked very inconsistently.  When I called the manufacturer I was told ""Well, it\'s a very sensitve computer, you can\'t just let them toss it around, that must be why you\'re having trouble""  Actually, I was having my 2 year sit in his high chair while I supervised him, and he was not doing anything to it.  I mean, it says it\'s for 2 year olds on the box....  Anyway, I returned it and got my money.  SAve your money for real music lessons.",5
"Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge","Recently I have purchased the musical mozart blocks set for my two and a half year old daughter at a toys r us department store near me as a Christmas gift for her this year and they had one of the toys out on display. She loved the toy and it is very educational. I had a hard time leaving the store because she wanted to continue to play with it although she is young enough that even though she was with me while I purchased her toys for Christmas this year that she had completely forgotten about it and that I haought this toy for her. My only complaint is that I had to pay [$$$] for this toy and they had told me that the sale on the toy had ended yesterday but this toy I knew was still available online here for [$$$] which is a really good price and I do not think it is right for them to sell it for the other price when it can be bought cheaper. Anyways I liked the toy alot and my daughter did too and that is why I purchased the toy even at the price I  had to pay for it. I think it will get a lot of use out of it and so will my 8 month old daughter when she is old enough as well.",5

"Sesame Street Baby Purse Playset","My girls love this Sesame Street purse! There are 5 items that can be placed inside of the purse. They use it when they pretend to go shopping around the house. It was a little tricky for my 18 month old to figure out how to open it but she eventually learned. The bright colors, durable design and sweet Sesame Street character faces make it such a fun purchase!",5
"my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve","I bought this for my son when he was 4 months old.  He loves all the little animals, but even now at 8 months, he doesn\'t seem interested in putting them in the fish bowl.  However, he will take them out if they are in there.  My son is very active, so maybe that\'s contributing to why he doesn\'t really use the bowl...",3
"my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve","I purchased this item for my son and its going to be returned the star fish he cant hold on to the fish the only thing he can hold on to was the crab and he liked that because it crinkled.. This is not Our favorite Lamaze toy and it will be going back to the store..",3
"my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve","My one-year-old baby loves this toy!  She loves to take the fish in and out, and watch through the transparent sides as she takes them in and out.  She loves to play peek-a-boo through the sides.  She loves to shake/squeeze each fish to hear its noise.  Downside: the fish are easy to misplace, so keeping all four together is a challenge.",5
"my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve","I bought this toy to help stimulate my eight-month-old\'s development. When I got it in the mail, I immediately opened it and gave it to her. She has been playing with it since. Her favorite is the crinkle crab because she can make him make noise. She is fascinated by the others. She very quickly learned how to take them out and put them back into the bowl. She has had no difficulty in doing that. Great item, worth the money!! And it is so fun to watch!!",5
"my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve","Everyone knows nap time can be difficult, my daughter fights it everyday, sometimes she\'ll even jump around and hit the sides of her crib. We decided putting some of those cribside toys made of hard plastic was unrealistic at this point, however I saw this and got it right away.Although we had tried stuffed animals and other soft toys this works he best. It\'s a lot more interactive compared with just hugging her teddy bear. Everyday she plays with it, it also occupies her in the morning when she first wakes. I walk into her room and there she is holding her fishy. Plus if she rolls on it during the night there\'s no chance of hurting herself. She loves it.Great value! Something a little different.",5
"my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve","This is a very good toy that helps manual dexterity and the ability to recognize figures behind the clear plastic. My baby girl especially loves the crinkle crab and the clam !",5
"my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve","We first bought this toy for our oldest child when she was just beginning to sit up and play with toys.  She would sit in her crib and play for a hour or more just putting the sea creatures in and out.  It gave Mommy shower and make-up time!  We believe she loved the clear plastic on the bowl and the shape and feel of the pieces.  We had the same experience with daughter #2.  We have bought this several times for other new parents.  Our girls have also received similar toys (not Lamaze) ex: a cookie jar and have not enjoyed it anywhere near as much.  A little toy with big entertainment value!",5
"my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve","I saw this toy before I was pregnant and though it was so cute!So after I had my daughter, I had the best excuse to buy it!!!She loves it.  I bought it for her when she was about 3 months old.  She\'d chew on the little clam.  Now she uses it to learn that they make noise, and she can put them in and take them out of the bowl.It\'s worth the money.  Cute, educational, (quiet.. heh), and durable.",5
"my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve","We received this as a present for our 6 month old.  I don\'t really think she\'s old enough to put the individual toys in the fishbowl, but she sure loves playing with them!  I\'ve noticed that she likes &quot;crinkly&quot; toys, so she loves the crab.  So far, it has kept her very entertained.  I really like Lamaze products so far",4
"my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve","I bought this toy for my baby and for friends\' babies as well. The babies really love the faces on the toys and get a kick out of the different sounds each one makes. They enjoy looking at them through the clear plastic and taking them out and putting them back in over and over. Most kids seem fascinated by ocean creatures anyway, so I think it\'s bound to be a guaranteed &quot;hit&quot; for any child. My 2 1/2 year old still loves to play with the crab!",4
"my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve","This toy was given to my son by his grandmother.  I saw Lamaze and immediately thought it would be a great toy.  Not the case.My son received this fish bowl when he was about 4 months old.  He is now 9 months.  He chews on the crab for hours, but other than that not much else.  I feel that this is an expensive teething toy.I like the variety of color and the different textures of fabric the toy offers.",2
"my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve","I bought this for my son when he was 6mos.  He LOVED it!  What great little teethers each of the sea creatures make.  However, 1.5mos down the road, he totally ignored it.  It was beyond his developmental path.  Cute toy, but I\'m not sure it\'s worth it.",3
"Pedal Farm Tractor","We chose this tractor and trailer for a family gift for our two-year-old son and he loves it!  Visiting friends love it, too.  We looked at several others, but this one seemed to be the safest and most durable.  He cannot pedal the tractor yet, but loves to push it around or be pushed while sitting on it and will soon grow to it (he is tall).  The trailer is a great addition and our son loves to fill it with toys (or his little brother!).  The only negative is that the ""hitch"" for the trailer does not lock in place and can be turned causing the trailer to come off at bad times, but we would still recommend it.  The assembly was easy and our little farmer has been thrilled!",5
"Pedal Farm Tractor","I bought this for my son when he was 3 years old.  He is now 8 and handed it down to my younger son when he turned 2.  After 5 years of rough and tough riding it is just now starting to break down.  This has been an awesome toy.  We also purchased the trailer and the boys have loved them both.  I think it would have lasted even longer if my 8 year old would have stayed off of it after he had outgrown it.  Anyway the only thing you need to keep in mind is that there is no brake so be careful on hills.",5
"Pedal Farm Tractor","We bought this tractor to accompany the trailer.  Our grandsons are big into farm stuff and love to load up the trailer and pretend they are working ""on the farm.""  It is best for those old enough to reach the pedals (age 3 and up?).  It is very sturdy and durable.  Great toy for those busy toddlers and preschoolers.  Worth every penny it cost!",5
"Pedal Farm Tractor","We bought this tractor for our 2 and a half-year-old son, and he is able to pedal and manuever this vehicle very well, despite the recommended age of 3-6 years. This tractor is very sturdy, and nearly impossible to tip over. My son has deserted all other riding toys in favor of this tractor. I highly recommend purchasing the yellow trailer that is specifically made for this tractor, but is sold separately .... My son loads all kinds of treasures into the trailer and farms the yard for long periods of time....",5
"Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles","We bought these for our son when he turned two. He had seen them at a playmate\'s home and LOVED them. I liked them b/c unlike some of the other cars for sale...there is some learning value and they are VERY durable. They have been thrown, rolled, stepped on, etc and still show no signs of wear. Highly recommend!",5
"Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles","My son loves stacking cups, so a friend recommended this toy to me.  My son loves it and he enjoys pushing them around the floor.  They nest nicely into each other, which makes it a great toy for the diaper bag.",5
"Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles","My son Cameron just loves these great little stacking cars!  He enjoys stacking them and slapping them down and each has great little things that they do such as his fire truck has a ladder that clicks up and down, police car has a spinning &quot;light&quot; bar, and so on.  I think it\'s great, brightly colored and has great little faces....I would give this as a gift in the future, not a wasted toy, Oh the little wheels roll, too!",5
"Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles","My one year old son received these as a birthday gift. He loves them. Not only are they stackable, which helps with hand-eye coordination, but each car has individual moveable features. Although these features are small, they got his attention. The bright colors are nice also. They are a great buy for the price!  I highly recommend them as first trucks for a small child.",5
"Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles","I purchased this toy for my great grandson\'s first Christmas. He will be 6 months old. I can\'t wait to play with it with him. This is the first baby in our family for 18 years and all the family is waiting for the fun... I will be ordering a lot more soon. Thank you for the convenient shopping. AJ\'S Gee-Gee (Great Grandmom)",5
"Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles","I\'ve owned this set for several years.  My 4 granddaughters love to play with the cars.  Stacking, nesting, playing with the few moving parts.  It is one of their favorite toys when they come over.  And it is definitely one of mine - Lots of play value that stores very well.  They have learned colors, and numbers with these also.",4
"Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles","These are a huge hit with my one year old son.  We received these cars as a gift when my son was first born.  He started taking a real interest in them when he was about seven months old and still plays with them every day.  They are simple, durable, do not require batteries, and are easy to clean.  We\'ve traveled a lot with my son and these make terrific travel toys as they pack up easily and don\'t take up much space since they nest.  The smallest car rattles and is the perfect size for little hands.",5
"Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles","This is a great toy.  The wheels really work and each car has a special feature.  They store easily for packing on trips and putting away.  Both of my kids (boy and girl) have played with them.  They are brightly colored.  And best of all, these do not use batteries!",5
"Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles","My 11 month old received these last Christmas and he instantly began running them along the floor and playing with them. He is now 22 months and I have taught him his colors using these and he STILL loves to play with them.  One got run over by an electric scooter and it didn\'t even break! All parents should get these for your baby.  This is the one toy that will NOT sit and collect dust!",5
"Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles","My 14 month old son loves to stack and play with these little cars.  They are durable and easy to clean.  I throw them in  the diswasher and they hold up great.  They are well worth the money to me.",5
"Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles","Great toys, we always pack one or two in the diaper bag, our 7 month old loves to play with them and I don\'t worry at all about him chewing on these toys as there are only smooth surfaces",5
"Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles","My son has played with these from 6 months old, and still likes them occasionally (18 months now).  The small car is nice for babies to shake.  They don\'t do much, but they are cute.",4
"Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles","After being inundated with toys that require batteries and make so much noise this was a breath of fresh air. My son loves these vehicles! We got this when he was 6 months old. We stack them on top and he loves to knock it over. We nest them and he loves to find the surprise vehicle underneath. Now that he is 8 months old he is figuring out that the wheels move as well as some of the other moving features on each vehicle. I highly recommend this toy.",5
"Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles","I bought these for my 1 1/2 year old, and he loves them (and so does his 5-year old brother). They both stack the cars, hide them and ""vrroomm"" them. It is great to find a toy that doesn\'t need batteries or require an engineering degree to put together!Highly recommended.",4
"Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles","We bought these trucks for our 15 mo. old daughter and 4 mo. old son- We love them!  They are nesting which is fun for our daughter to look underneath the trucks to find the next one or they can stack one on top of the other to make a tower.  Perfect first trucks!  And they aren\'t too big- a perfect size!",5
"Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles","My son got this stacking truck set as a baby gift.  He was able to play with the trucks at about 6 months and they are still played with today (my son will be 2 next month). The overall durability of this toy is great; they look as good as when we got them even after lots of play and being taken along on many trips. I have not seen this toy in any store - so get it here while you still can!  It has been a much used toy and I highly recommend it for your small child.",5
"Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles","I bought the cars because they were easy to store, plus they were cars.  What I have found is that I can actually use then in many places since there is more than one vehicle.  Mostly they are easy to pack for a trip.",4
"Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles","My daughter loves these vehicles. She likes to watch them disappear as you stack them inside each other. And she loves to stack them atop of each other. Then she plays with them as cars, and even makes the sounds they make. They are wonderful fun toys, and great to take with you on trips, they are compact!",5
"Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles","My son loves this stacking toy. It is much more fun than the stackable rings toy even though he does have that one too. All the boys at our baby group have it and the babies who don\'t always come up to see what it is all about! You can\'t go wrong with this purchase.",5
"Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles","I got this toy for my daughter when she was very little.  She really hasn\'t been interested until recently.  Now she loves to put little people inside the cars and look at them through the top.  She lets objects play hide-and-seek under the cars but she really doesn\'t stack them or nest them very much.  I think they are worth the money because they were fairly cheap but she hasn\'t really used them for the intended purpose.  I don\'t think I would buy them again but I certainly wouldn\'t take them back if they were given to me. I think my daughter will use them in different ways with other toys, in the tub or pool or even outside as she grows.  They are extremely durable.",4
"Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles","Okay, well they don\'t really beep.  (But my 11-month old son loves when we roll these along and SAY &quot;beep beep!&quot;)  At this point, my son\'s favorite aspect of these cars is the little sunroof, siren and ladder on the tops.  He can sit there for ten minutes just flipping the sunroof back and forth!  Go figure!  These cars are super sturdy and have taken quite a beating on our coffee table.  (They\'re in much better shape than the coffee table at this point.)  I love that they nest together so they don\'t take up too much space when they\'re put away.  I also like that he can grow into them once he understands the nesting/stacking part better.  A great toy...gets played with each and every day!",5
"Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles","For well over a year my son has enjoyed stacking and playing with these cars. They have held up brilliantly to his abuse - they still look like new. Fun to stack, fun to roll. Clever toy that has been a winner with my son since he was one.",5
"Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles","We just bought this for my 9 month old daughter,she loves these cars, loves to turn the wheels and lookat the faces. She especially loves the little green car,it\'s the perfect size to fit in her tiny hand and it rattles.This toy is a hit! I highly recommend it.",5
"Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles","My son got this for Christmas and he loves all the cars.  His favorite is the fire truck.  He plays with it for a while.",4
"Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles","This is a wonderful toy that is fun, educational, and affordable! The cars are different colors, and each has a different number, 1 - 4, to help a child learn counting and colors. They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.(The nesting feature is great for storage too). Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck\'s ladder moves, etc.) The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto. At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth. I imagine this toy will remain one of my son\'s favorites as he learns to stack them and roll them on the floor. I would highly recommend this item.",5
"Fisher-Price Slumbertime Soother with Remote Control","My mother-in-law bought 2 of these for our twin boys-- one for each crib-- and they have been a life saver in getting our boys to settle down at night and go to sleep. Now our boys do not sleep without it! Anytime we are going somewhere overnight, we take at least one with us. It is also the only toy that plays music by itself for more than 30 sec. It will play for about 10 minutes!! It\'s our standard gift for all of our parent friends.",5
"Fisher-Price Slumbertime Soother with Remote Control","My daughter had this in her crib until she was 2 and loved it.  When she got old enough she loved to turn it on and off by herself.  I used this every night for her to go to sleep by. I used the place that you store the remote control in for extra pacifiers, so if she lost one during the night she would know where to find one.  I never used the remote, but loved the idea another had about putting in the car for rear facing infants when they get fussy you could just turn it on with the remote.  It\'s not too bright and the volume is adjustable.  Someone had said it eat batteries quickly,but I found that they lasted a very LONG time and I used it EVERY night. I highly recommend this product!!",5
"Fisher-Price Slumbertime Soother with Remote Control","I bought this product when my son was about 10 months old.  He was still having problems going to sleep at night and naptime.  The Slumbertime Soother is great.  I sing along with the songs.  My son turns it on himself and sometimes just plays with it.  The nature sounds relax him.  I really like the fact that it plays for ten minutes without stopping.",5
"Sassy 836 - Fascination Station","I bought this toy for an addition to my son\'s exerciser. However, it would not stick (to anything)!! I tried everything to make it stick. It was very frustrating.",1
"Sassy 836 - Fascination Station","i bought this beautie at k mart for 5 bucks. other that the suction cup not really working out well, my 3 month old loves it. hell, my husband and i also enjoy playing with it. it has a variey of colours and shapes that help stimulate the mind. you cant lose.",4
"Sassy 836 - Fascination Station","I bought this to use on the high chair, but within 2 days my son had the rattle part off the base. Needless to say it never went back on for more than 5 min. BUT he did enjoy it in the car and other places.",3
"Sassy 836 - Fascination Station","My son loved this toy.  He enjoyed playing with it in his highchair until he was 10 months old.  At that point he was strong enough to pull the toy from its\' base.  He pulled it so hard, he smashed himself in the face with it.  After that upsetting experience, we didn\'t put it in the base anymore.  He did still play with it as a rattle, but it did not hold his attention as well.  I would like to see this toy redesigned so that it cannot be separated from its\' base.",3
"Sassy 836 - Fascination Station","My son is nearly a year old and received this toy about 9 months ago.  We both love Sassy toys.  This one is bright and amusing.  Stick it on a car window, high chair tray, restaurant table, bathroom tile,...  We were disappointed in the life of the suction cup, but for all other reasons--color, amusement, education, and co-ordination--get one of these!",5
"Sassy Smiley Face Rattle","This toy is very cute, it has two handles for little hands to grasp, a mirror on one side and on the other the smiley face! the face has wiggly eyes and a nose to beep. but the nose can be frusterating for babies as my 18month old son still has a hard time beeping it! my all in all a cute,durable toy!!",5
"Sassy Circle Rattle","My son (who is now 2+ yrs) loved this rattle as a baby.  He loved it so much that I have given it to all of my mommy- friends as a gift.  This is the best toy to have for a young baby.  You will get them to smile for those all-important-photos with this one!!",5
"Sassy Circle Rattle","Both of my sons love this toy. My two year old played with it when he was a baby, and it found its way to the bottom of his toy box at Granny\'s. We found it about a month ago and his 5 month old baby brother began to play with it. Suprise Suprise he loves it too! And his big brother tries to steal it away. This toy is durable, and fun. What more could mom ask for??",5
"Sassy Circle Rattle","What I don\'t love about this is that the clear part, where the baby can watch the beads move with motion, contains BPA.  However, my daughter found this rattle a comfort to her while teething and chewed only the big protruding ball, which as far as I know is free from both PVC and BPA.  I thought she would like the textures of the rings, but nope, it was all about the ball.Also appreciated the bright colors.  This is a good bang for your buck baby toy -- for a while there we always had it in the diaper bag when we left the house.Best at about 6-12 months.  Can\'t see it getting a lot of use before 3 months and just not interesting to a toddler, even a toddler who is still teething.",5
"Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle","I was concerned about the chemical content of this ""plastic"" book since a baby will undoubtedly stick it in his mouth. I emailed Sassy and got a reply saying that this was BPA, PVC and Phtalates free. I can breathe a sigh of relief when I hand this to our baby...soon!",5
"Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle","We bought this for our 5 month old and put pictures of relatives that live far away inside the pages.  The book is very sturdy, &quot;chewable&quot; and has a lot of great colors/designs to look at.  Now at 8 months, this book is still one her favorites!  Plus she sees her grandma\'s and grandpa\'s, etc, faces every day.  We love it.",5
"Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle","I bought this for a new granddaughter.  I will not get to see her often as she lives in another state.  This book is great for out pictures and she can carry it around and look at the pictures as she would a book.  This way she can recognize us when we show up.  It is easy to carry and cleaning it is simple.  It is a great little photo book.",5
"Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle","I originally bought this for my 4 month old son, but my 17 month old daughter has taken it over.  We filled it with pictures of mom and dad, 2 sets of grandparents, and all the cousins with their families (there are only 6 slots for pics, but we took pictures of entire families - so we have 20 people in all).  She loves pointing to the pictures and identifying various people.  The pages are made out of thin plastic material and filled with foam, so are pretty soft, but still durable. The slots are sized for 3x5 inch pictures.  My 4 month old hasn\'t gotten much out of it yet, but I\'m sure he\'ll love it just as much in months to come.",5
"Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle","This is a nice photo book for babies as it has clear plastic sleeves to protect the pictures you place inside.",5
"Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle","Based on articles on the dangers of PVC plastic books, this book was tested and found to contain chemicals that are highly toxic for babies and toddlers. This materials have already been banned from children\'s toys in Europe.In order to read the many articles online that specifically name this book as having been found to contain chemicals that are dangerously toxic for children, google ""toxic bath books"" or the title of the book with the word ""toxic.""This book\'s concept is wonderful, but those who love children should share photos in another kind of album or book.",1
"Earlyears: Earl E. Bird with Teething Rings","We received an Earl E. Bird as a gift when we had our first baby eleven years ago. Since then, Earl has seen us through teething for three kids, and is still in good condition for our fourth baby!  He\'s a little faded around the edges, but just as loveable and soft, with difference textures for a chewy, drooly baby to gnaw on.I like that he\'s fully washable, and a nice quiet toy (at least in ours, the squeaker was very quiet to begin with and has since kind of stopped squeaking--but the squeaker was never the big attraction with Earl).  Perfect for taking on planes, or in church, or in the car. A great baby shower gift, since Earl is perfect for a boy or a girl.",5
"Earlyears: Earl E. Bird with Teething Rings","This little toy is safe for infants, and offers great color, texture and even sound.  Very Sweet, though a little pricey.",5
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","a wonderful learning tool and made very well so little hands cant rip it apart., my grandson loved the different colors and fabric,",5
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","This was given as a gift for my great grandson and they seemed very satisfied with it.  I haven\'t talked to them to see how he responded to it.",4
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","This is exactly like the one I had when I was a kid. My son really enjoys it and it keeps him entertained.",5
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","I had a book similar to this as a child and it brings back wonderful memories! My 20 month old struggles with several of the items, such as the shoe laces and snaps. But he loves the zipper and the Velcro shapes and the other pages give him a great way to learn and practice. Overall it\'s an item that he can grow into and it\'s super cute!",5
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","My daughter enjoys taking it apart more than putting it back together, but a great product.  It has kept her occupied while flying.",5
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","Got this for a plane ride 3 months ago. The snaps are hard to snap and he gets frustrated. Most pieces are attached to the book which is nice, he can\'t lose them. He flips thru it but that is about it. Maybe when we travel again he will find it more interesting. We keep it for trips only so it will be ""new"" each time. He has seen it up on the shelf and asks for it but when we give it to him he is done flipping thru in a few minutes and it is left on the floor for other books.",4
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","I bought this for my grandbaby for Christmas. She loves it and my daughter kept saying it was such a neat toy.",5
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","My 8 month toddler enjoys this book. Very good idea with mind-stimulating activities on each page. Well worth it for the price.",5
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","Well made and quite a few different textures.Toddler loved this book and Mom approved, too.Everyone was happy with this selection.",5
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","Just what I wanted, but did\'t have the time to sew myself! Love it! My granddaughter  just loves playing with this wonderful book.",5
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","I really like this book. You can show your baby shapes, teach her how to use buttons, zipper and snaps, tie a shoe and tell time. My baby is too young for most of these activities at this time, but she already loves to play with this book. I see a lot of quality time spent with this book in the future.",5
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","My 2 yr+ old grand daughter liked this book a lot.  She did have a hard time with some the buttons or snaps.  They were sewn pretty tight to the backing and was kind of hard to get her fingers under to be able to button or snap.  Overall, she did enjoy each activity.",4
"Lullaby and Goodnight by Pockets of Learning","I ordered this book for the up-coming birthday of a grandson. It really is cute and an excellent quality. It comes with a small stuffed bear that you can remove from the book. Each page of the book has a different night-time activity for the bear to do such as have a glass of milk, brush his teeth etc. I\'m not exactly sure what I was expecting because even though it is a quality toy I\'m not sure that Liam will use it enough to make it worth the price I paid.  The Pockets of Learning toys all seem to be very high quality if somewhat pricy.",4
"Lullaby and Goodnight by Pockets of Learning","Both of my boys liked playing with this book.  They also liked to take the bear out and play with him.  The pajamas are a little hard to put on, but they didn\'t seem to care much.  My youngest actually has slept with the little bear!",4
"Lullaby and Goodnight by Pockets of Learning","This book is very cute, and despite other comments I found it to be well made. My son is not real interested though but maybe he will later on. I just think that it doesn\'t have enough pages and interactivity for the price you are paying.",3
"Lullaby and Goodnight by Pockets of Learning","This is a cute, interactive book made out of fabric. It walks you though the night routine (1. Drink your milk, 2. Brush your teeth, 3. Take off your clothes, 4. take a bath, 5. Put on pajamas, 6. Bedtime story, 7. Say a prayer, 8. Lullaby and goodnight) - works well for praying people - unfortunately, I bought it for an agnostic family!",3
"Baby Monitor - Direct Link Privacy Monitor","Considering how horrible the selection is these days for choosing a quality baby monitor that doesn\'t transmit to anyone and everyone who may be listening in, intentionally or unintentionally, this seems to be one of the best choices to make.  Your scrambled voice will sound like Donald Duck on a regular analog 46-49 mhz cordless phone or radio scanner, so it\'s at least a moderate roadblock for the average signal interceptor.  However, why on earth there is no 900 mhz (or higher) digital-spread-spectrum baby monitor on the market is beyond me.  So, this unit is one of the better compromises out there, and at ... on amazon.com, it is amazingly affordable.",3
"North American Bear Company Sleepyhead Bunny Blue, Blue Stripe, Medium","This is a perfect baby gift:  washable, no parts on which to choke, snuggly, VERY durable and best of all you can give the same gift to all children in the family, by just monogramming an ear.",5
"North American Bear Company Sleepyhead Bunny Blue, Blue Stripe, Medium","My 3 year old son goes EVERYWHERE with Blue Bunny. This is his 6th one since he was born. Considering the amount of time he spends with Blue Bunny, they are probable pretty durable - I wash them about once a week. The great thing about him is there is nothing that can hurt my son on Blue. He is so soft and cozy. Great friend for small children.",5

"Big and Small Chime Ball by Sassy","This is an iteresting ball that my baby has loved from about 6 months to 18+ months.  The chime is pleasant, not annoying and this ball is easy for a baby to pick up and manipulate.  It is my understanding that the Sassy line is BPA and Phalate free, so you dont have to worry about your child putting this toy in her mouth.",5
"Big and Small Chime Ball by Sassy","This toy is a hardier toy than most, I found it is a great toy for my middle sized parrots who love to play with balls with bells in them. So far this toy has lasted almost a year now.",5
"Big and Small Chime Ball by Sassy","My daughter is 4 months old and she really loves this ball as its very easy for her to hold - a skill she\'s just learned.",4
"Pooh Baby\'s First Tigger","Perfect for young children and overall good quality for the price.",5
"Pooh Baby\'s First Tigger","I actually got the ""Pooh"" one which for some reason is not advertised on babiesrus.com/amazon.I believe that toys like this sometimes are more for the parents as opposed to the babies, but still it is a cute toy!  It went with my newborn son everywhere we went because it fit perfectly with him in his carrier and it was a cute, small toy we could use to interact with.  At 9-months-old he\'s not at that age where he\'s hugging, chewing, just all out playing with his toys and he likes it for that reason.  But babies need more that just stuffed animals.  He\'s obviously much more interested in toys that make sounds or light so his Pooh mostly stays in his room with the other \'dolls\'.This is still a cute item.  I haven\'t had to wash it yet, but it sure is durable.",5
"Pedella Wooden Push Toy","This is a must have for any toddler!  I bought one for my brothers triplets who were 1 1/2 years old at the time.  They loved it!  One would push & the other 2 would chase after it.  They love watching the duck waddle & its feet go round & round.  Best of all, no batteries!  Yaayyyy!!Fifteen years ago, I bought my daughter a little push clown from the same company.  It was her favorite toy & was passed onto her brother.  With heavy playing by 2 children it never lost any of its paint or parts.  It\'s something we are saving for grandchildren one day.",5
"Infant Stim-mobile","Love this mobile!  It is challenging and their eyes are drawn to it.  My son couldn\'t look at it until he got older as he didn\'t like high contrast, but at @ 7 mo he got into it.  If you are a parent who appreciates observing the small nuances of learning that occur in the development process--you will be able to witness it with this toy.  I\'m not a parent trying to turn my children into geniuses, but definitely into maximizing their capabilities to incite their own curiosities.  Keeping children zoned out is not a priority--so for those who want to do that--turn on the tv and buy toys with bells and whistles.  For others, get toys like this one.",5
"Infant Stim-mobile","We found this at a garage sale and I read about it and it seemed really interesting so I bought it. This is for the first few months of a baby\'s life and should not move much, contrary to what the first poster said, because you want stimulation but you don\'t want to over-stimulate a baby. However, we did notice that sometiems our baby does like the mobile to move and it is summer here but the air conditioner blowing air around the room should be enough movement. When it\'s not moving, we can just put a small fan on its lowest setting about 6 feet from the crib and the small wiggling was enough movement to keep her stimulated but not so much movement that she can\'t keep track of the object (babies this young are not good at tracking so you don\'t want a lot of motion), but still we only do this once in a while, not at all times.One of the best things about this mobile is that our baby only wakes us up at night to feed. If she wakes herself up she will sit and stare at it for a long time and be happy since we have a small nightlight in the room. Any time we put her in the crib we can see her staring at the simple shapes. Shown in the picture on the product page is the detailed shapes, you flip the cardboard from the simple to the detailed shapes when they are about 2 months old, then remove this mobile for a more \'traditional\' one with movement and objects the baby can grab at about 4 months. This is a somewhat delicate mobile since it uses air currents to move, so you need to keep it safe from a grabbing/eating baby.Also, one nice feature is that ours came with a travel pack, or at least that\'s how I\'m using it. Besides the crib mount, there is an 8 inch circular plastic ring with fishing wire for hanging the mobile. You can hang it anywhere with a string, either taping string to the ceiling or tying it to any overhang. It also came with a cardboard carrying case thing which is very thin and easy to take with you on a trip.For those with a math/science background, it\'s really interesting to note that first side of the cards have objects with very low spatial frequency. The \'detailed\' sides are actually the same patterns, but with a moderately higher spatial frequency. After 4 months, you use standard mobiles, which have very high spatial frequencies, as well as colors and things the baby can grab to improve hand-eye coordination. Basically, you start showing the child very low frequency objects that are easy to observe and track, then gradually move up until they can use the high frequency information.Now, I want to explain why I did not give this item 5 stars even though it\'s an amazing product. Before my baby was a month old, I noticed that she was already able to detect some colors and this stim-mobile is only black and white. This is from 1990, so I guess over the last 20 years they have refined the product so that the simple side has some red (first color a baby sees) and other simple colors, while the reverse side has more vivid colors, but uses the same idea of going from low spatial frequencies to higher spatial frequencies. I ordered the newest version but still kept this around for changing table and pack n play entertainment since she loves it. If I had not known about the improved version, I would have given it 5 stars, but there is something better available so I highly recommend getting the updated version for every newborn.",4
"Fisher Price - Baby Bowling","I\'m really disappointed with this toy.  It never kept my daughter\'s attention.",1
"Fisher Price - Baby Bowling","Cute toy, durable and is simple. Nothing sings, light up or dances...just what our kids truly need. Everything talks, spins, lights up....it is hard to find SIMPLE stimulation toys that kids have to manipulate themselves. This set challenges kids mentally as they try to figure out a. how to roll a ball b. how to aim the ball c. how to knock the pins down d. how to pick up the wobbly little guys. also you can tell your child \'aim for the red guy\' or \'aim for the yellow guy\'. great for teaching basic colors and counting too. don\'t forget you can always say WOW you knocked ONE over...and so forth. great all around and gets tossed around too so clearly after using for a month and being bashed on teh floor by little hands trying to figure out how to bounce the not bouncy ball (exploration) nothing has broken.",5
"Rattlesnake Squirt","Not that==> I &lt;==would -- ever -- do it, or recommend it, but there is a gag called theRattlesnake Eggsprank.It is nothing more than a simple mechanism hidden in an envelope that says:""WARNING: RATTLESNAKE EGGS. KEEP AWAY FROM HEAT TO AVOID HATCHING!""I can just picture someone putting a few of these prank envelopes in the backseat of""somebody\'s"" car next to one of these snakes. The first slight bump -- while driving --will produce a r=a=t=t=l=i=n=g sound which should MORE than just shake someone upwhen they look behind them and noticethe SNAKE!What an excellent, cruel, gag. Not for your parents---or grand parents---for OBVIOUS reasons!",5
"Comfy Easy PC Play &amp; Learn Keyboard","This product was very innovative when introduced in 1997-8.  It sold at FAO Schwarts for about $100 and we got it for our 18 month old daughter.  She used it until she was at least 3 (we then moved to Reader Rabbit).  The way it worked then -  you plugged the key board into the printer port and the sw was on two CDs. The keyboard did not require mouse skills, just visual selection of very large buttons.  Very interactive, very educational for the toddler/preschool set.  The developer was Israeli and they did not have good US distribution.  It now seems that they finally found someone to distribute it.",5
"Comfy Easy PC Play &amp; Learn Keyboard","I have to say, the first time we played with this I thought it was going to be a dud and I was thinking I would send it back.  It\'s very simple and not much interaction to it.  But it turns out my 2 year old daughter loves it.  She gets a kick out of it and it\'s all she needs in a toy.(This is the Comfy PC and not the Elmo toy.)",4
"Comfy Easy PC Play &amp; Learn Keyboard","My daughter loves this product! It covers her 2 favorite things the PC and the phone! Whenever I am on the computer she is always on my lap trying to push whatever keys she can, but with this I can put her in her highchair and put her in front of the PC and she will entertain herself for at least an hour!  She espicially loves the phone aspect on the side and what I love is there is no cord to worry about. I would definitely reccommend this to anyone with a toddler, I started using this with my daughter when she was 12 months old, she is now 15 months and loves it more now that she has gone up to another level!",4
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","all three of my kids have had one of these teethers, and it\'s been the favorite for all of them. i buy one for any expectant friend or family member. in our experience, the batteries last about a year & 1/2.",5
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","I\'ve tried this for almost 6 months at different points of our kid teething and she\'s just not that into this. It\'s really heavy for a baby. When I would hold the vibrating setting on my kid would watch for a bit and even try it but just seemed bored with it and would move on. The yellow part also attracts dust and fiber out of the air like a magnet. It is ALWAYS dirty. I\'m not that particular when it comes to dirt and baby stuff but it grosses me out. It\'s also only wire clean, so it\'s a more high maintenance toy.",2
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","This teether is ridiculous. It\'s huge, it\'s hard to clamp down on, and my daughter had no idea what was going on when it started vibrating in her mouth.It\'s just too big, awkward, and hard to push down on. Not worth the money, in my opinion.",1
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","One of my friends recommended this for me for my daughter when she was teething. It was the only thing that made her stop crying when she was teething and I tried everything imaginable. I had to hold it to make it vibrate because her mouth wasn\'t strong enough but it made her so happy and cuddly that is far from a complaint. Have recommended it to lots of my friends and they all love it.",5
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","Great teether as it has a good texture, is easy to handle and massages the gums while baby is chewing on it.",5
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","I ordered this product after reading many of the other reviews, and I\'m also pleased with this purchase. My daughter is 10-months-old and her first tooth just came through, and we\'d tried everything to soothe her gums: ice cubes, teething rings, cold washcloths, you name it. At first she wasn\'t terribly interested in the toy, but then I took it and put it in my mouth and handed it back to her. She put it in her mouth, and I squeezed the other side to make it vibrate. The look on her face was priceless! Her eyebrows went up and I noticed she bit down harder (so I could let go), and she seemed to really like the vibration. This has since become her go-to toy when her gums seem to bother her. Also, I discovered she likes to have the little roller on the handle rubbed up and down her back. All in all this is a really well made toy that worked for my daughter exactly how I\'d hoped.",5
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","my 5mth old daughter really likes this teething toy. it has just the right amount of vibration and it triggered easily enough where she can activate it herself with little effort. i like that the 3 sides of the star have different ribbing so it feels different on her gums. great product for the money and a must have for a teething baby.",5
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","My 10 month old grandson thought the movement of this toy was funny! He laughs when it moves! Saying this, he does put it in his mouth but pulls it out to laugh So, I love this Teether because it makes him so happy NOT because it massages his teeth!",5
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","My four month old started teething around two months, he has pretty impressive motor skills when it comes to using his hands but this teether is huge and you really have to apply quite a bit of pressure for it to vibrate. My other son who is two and also teething shows absolutely no intrest in this at all. Maybe in a couple more months....",1
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","It is a good teether for my handicapped student. But the ability to bit down is required which is hard for my student.",4
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","It is a great toy for them to chew and play with, but it is a bit harder for smaller babies to chew on. The vibration was a bit stronger than I was expecting, but it does not seem to bother my son a bit.",5
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","My daughter is two months and loves this in her mouth.  She seem to like the points and the softer rubber than theInfantino Vibrating Strawberry Teether.  Also it requires less pressure to make vibrate.  No she is not teething yet and no she cannot make it vibrate yet.  But if you pinch it for her, their are three different point surfaces and yes she has her favorite.  If she is getting a bit cranky, there are times this will turn her back into all smiles.  At this point, she seems to ""chew"" and vigorously suck on the points.",5
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","This is a good idea but it takes a lot of pressure for my 7 month old granddaughter to make it vibrate.  I can squeeze one corner to make it vibrate while she chews on the other end.  Otherwise she chews it like a regular teething you.",3
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","The older one of these lasted us several years for my special needs daughter who likes the vibration. This one lasted 3 months before the battery died. Folks, you need to work on battery life or just go back to the old style teether!",1
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","A must in addition to all the teething toys. Next to Sophie the giraffe this is his favorite. I. Don\'t really know if the vibration massages. His gums, but he does enjoy biting into it a lot!",5
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","My little guy loves his star teether! It\'s great entertainment for him, and he likes the opposite spinning side too. It was easy to introduce to him, and easy to clean too!",5
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","This product sucks. My little boy LOVES to chew on things while he\'s teething - and he bites down hard. He was never able to bite hard enough to get this dumb thing to vibrate. Very disappointing.",1
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","The yellow part vibrates once little gums/teeth chomp down on it. easy to hold on to, can easily hook (Via rings or carabiner) to a diaper bag etc. Both my kids loved it while teething.",5
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","My son is 4 months old and can not quite get a hang of other teethers. Some of them you have to bend in a specific direction to make the vibration happen. This teether is great. They just bite down (naturally) and the vibration helps with the comfort. I love it!",5
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","This arrived the next day after I bought it and I was very grateful!  We had one other one that my son managed to lose and he was miserable without it!  It really helped soothe his mouth while he was teething!",5
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","I have two of these teethers and both see variable use as my little guy goes through teething spurts.In between, he actually likes sitting or kneeling on the star to get it to vibrate.But as soon as his gums start hurting, he goes straight for this toy.Also, it\'s a smart packaging extra to have the \'free ring\' on top which clearly doubles for hanging purposes.",4
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","My son is obsessed with this teether!! He was first more fascinated with spinning the bottom part and chewing on that but after 4 months of having it, he has now switched and loves the rubber/vibrating part. I don\'t know what I would do without this one, I think it is a must have! Not only a teether but a toy as well :)",5
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","I bought this for upcoming teething, and we still don\'t seem to be there, but my baby just thinks this thing is good fun.  She bites on it and the vibration cracks her up.  That\'s enough for me!",5
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","My LO is definitely teething and I\'ve tried giving this to her but she can never get the massager to go at it on her own.  I will have to put it in her mouth and press it at the same time.  She looks at me and I imagine her thinking &#34;what the heck is that&#34; and she pulls her face away.  I\'m hoping she\'ll want to use it again before her teeth actually come in since I can\'t return it at this point.  We\'re sticking to the fake keys and her little Sophie the Giraffe for now.",2
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","Bought this based on the reviews. My daughter is an early teether at 3 months old. My only complaint is that she has a hard time activating the vibration by biting hard enough. This has allot to do with her age. I have to hold one of the corners for her to activate the vibration. She LOVES it, I only wish it had an on/off switch so I didn\'t have to hold it for her. She actually cries when I try to take it away from her.",4
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","My baby loves the vibrations on his teeth. He also shakes it like a rattle. This product is good quality.",5
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","I\'ve bought several teethers and this i one of the best ones. The vibration helps ease the discomfort and the colors make it also very interesting.",5
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","I know it\'s a safety feature, but it is unfortunate that the batteries are not replaceable in this, because I will probably have to buy another one of these soon, because my little one LOVES this.  He seemed to hate all other teething options out there...even Sophie he had to learn to love (he\'s does like it now), but this he gnaws away on vigorously.The star shaped chewing part is a little big and that worried me a bit when I first got it, but it actually hasn\'t seemed to bother him that much.  So far (he got this at 5 months) he can\'t always make the vibration happen himself but, 1)It\'s not that difficult for me to just push down on it as I\'m holding it for him since I like how it calms him down and 2) even when it doesn\'t vibrate, he still loves to chew away at it.  He has learned over time a bit better about how hard to bite down to make it go too and that it will go by chewing on any of the three available &#34;tips&#34; to the star.He also really likes the little spinning rattle on the end and it has little nibs that he likes to chomp on too (even though it is hard plastic and the star is rubber like).  It is a &#34;substantial&#34;  toy though, so if your little one is in the phase of swinging toys around really hard, they may bonk themselves now and again, but our son seemed relatively un-phased by that.",5
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","I got this for my son when he was about 8 months. he loved bitting it and he carry it all over the house. He is now 18 months and it still works plus he still bits on it too. I found it very easy to clean too.",5
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","This thing is big. Baby can grow into it. It really does help when I hold it and turn it on for him. If he isn\'t done with it he is sure to let me know. Which to me translates that he likes it. I\'m not sure how I feel about the sticky feeling plastic, seems unnecessary and everything sticks to it.",4
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","If I can recommend one teether to buy for your teething baby, it would be this one. The vibration made it fun and it took the edge off for my little guy. The shape/handle made it really easy for him to hold. We never leave the house without this thing and it is the go-to gift I give to all my expecting friends.",5
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","Baby loves this teether. Nice to have something different from all of the other teethers out there. The nice thing is that when she no longer wants it to vibrate, she still has fun the with handle the spins. Great product and it has lasted despite being thrown all around.",5
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","I had bought a similar toy like this in the 90\'s for my daughter when she was teething and now she has children. I bought one for my grandson, then more recently this one for my granddaughter. Babies love the sensation it gives them when their front teeth are coming out and making them miserable. I believe it relieves them of some of their pain and I highly recommend any parent with teething babies to get this toy for them! It is a sturdy product and you don\'t have to worry about any little parts coming loose or damaged. My babies and grandkids abused theirs and it still took the beating.",5
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","We have another vibrating teether that is very similar to this one, there are some differences though.This one is much softer on the outside which could be nice on tender gums.This one has 3 points that she can use to pin point the problem area.Each point has a different texture (bumps, ridges) so there is some varianceThis one seems like it is easier to activateI will say that I don\'t know if she favors one for the other.  It seems like she uses them both about equally.She also likes to play with it by making it vibrate on her hands, feet, cheeks etc.  We have had a lot of fun playing with it.It\'s a great find and I wish I had come across it sooner.",5
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","This is great, my son loves it and it\'s pretty easy for him to hold he enjoys the vibrations when he chews on it.",5
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","A favorite in our house!",5
"The First Years Massaging Action Teether","I had this very teether for my twin boys 8 years ago and they absolutely loved it.  So, when my new baby started teething, I sought out the same teether.  I was surprised when it arrived and the packaging stated that the product is, ""safety tested"" for BPA, lead, and phthalates.  It does not state ANYWHERE on the package that it is BPA free.  As a former regulator (of medical devices) I am very sensitive about company labeling and statements.  Perhaps too much so.  But, I would rather err on the side of caution where my child is concerned, and the lack of clear ""BPA free"" labeling on this product gives me pause.  Specifically, when they test it for BPA, lead, and phthalates, is there an acceptable amount allowed?!  If not, why wouldn\'t the company simply label the product as BPA, lead, and phthalate free?Eight years ago, when I gave this toy to my sons, no one had ever heard of BPA.  My boys put all manner of plastic toys in their mouths, and I\'m sure it was all riddled with BPA.  But, in this day and age, when BPA is strongly suspected of being dangerous, I cannot in good conscience allow my new baby to chew on anything that MAY contain it.  And, though someone on this site indicated that a representative from the company TOLD them it was BPA free, I\'m still skeptical.  Again, why not label it as such?  Most companies proudly label their products with that simple language that cannot be confused.",2
"The First Years Soft Teething Beads","My son has had this teether since he was 3 months old. I thought maybe he\'s just too young & not interested in it(even though he did have 2 teeth already) He is now 8 months old, and still isn\'t very interested in this teether. The reason I bought it was because it was in-expensive and easy for him to hold & pick up. He would rather pick up a toy car, or some sort of stuffed toy, which I understand every child is different. My only big complaint - the star bead on the end. It is hard, and pointy. If it catches my son\'s sore, in-coming teeth the wrong way, he will cry. Other then that, the colors are great, and definitely catch baby\'s eye. Overall, it\'s an OK toy for the price.",3
"The First Years Soft Teething Beads","This teething ring is great!  We probably have enough toys to have our own toy store, including at least 2-3 of these teething rings! Our 10-mth-old baby loves to stick one of them in his mouth (like just one bead of it) and walk or crawl around with his hands free to hold other toys.  Our 7-mth-old, loves it too, with his favorite game being to simply have one of us sit it on his head and then wait for it to fall off when he moves.  He thinks it is hestarical.  It\'s amazing how much fun they can have with such a simple toy.",5
"The First Years Soft Teething Beads","My daughter loves this and it keeps her happy for a long time.  It is also very easy to wash to keep clean as well.",5
"The First Years Soft Teething Beads","My baby loves to play with this during bath time! It\'s easy for her to hold, bite and play with!",5
"Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim","I bought this for my 8 week old daughter, we are planning a trip to Texas and did not want to take the heavy stroller...I tried her in the sling,she got very hot and because of that she got heat rash all over her face and neck (she was only in the sling for about 10 minutes)!!!! I did not like all the padding, it makes it to bulky! On top of all that it gave me a back ache!!If you are serious about a sling I would choose the Maya, it is a thinner material, and is not bulky at all. That is what I ended up buying, and my daughter loves it and so do I.",1
"Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim","I thought this would be an excellent item to have. I was wrong! This is the most cumbersome thing I own and my son sweats like crazy in it. There\'s no support for the baby\'s neck or back, and I always feel like he\'s about to fall out of it. Unless you\'ve got really strong shoulders or a feather-weight infant, you might want to skip the infant carrier thing completely. Save yourself time and money on this - I wouldn\'t buy it again!!",1
"Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim","It is a little awkward at first, but I had an extremely premature baby who was too small for the traditional carriers, and needed to be held all the time.  I lived, cooked, did laundry, ate, and slept with this sling for 2 months.  Once my baby was bigger and needed to be held less I started using other carriers.  But now I\'m back to the sling because quite frankly, once you get the hang of it, its much, much easier to get baby in and out of it.",4
"Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim","I think the idea behind the sling is great but it is not for every baby.  Everytime our son is put in this he crys or screams.  He is an easy going fellow but he hasn\'t liked being held to closely.  He wants his freedom and this doesn\'t give much freedom to a newborn.  Also, the &quot;training&quot; video is more of a promotional advertisement.  I had to go to the web site to get more information about how to use it.",1
"Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim","This is a great product but it is just too big for me. If you are 5\'5&quot; inch. and below please do not get this cause it will look like a sack on you.  My baby was terrified and looked uncomfortable in it. She cried everytime I put her inside. Practice makes perfect but eventually my baby &amp; I got tired of using this.",1
"Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim","After reading all the great reviews on the sling I decided to try one.  We both hated it. Maybe because I\'m 5\'1 and my son was eleven pounds when he was born made it more difficult. I kept trying to make it work for us but after 6 months I gave it up. I ended up giving it away. It\'s not one size fits all. If you\'re short, think twice on this.",2
"Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim","I used this sling for both of my babies, (0-&gt; 2.5yrs). We had a front backpack style which was good for about 3 months, until the weight of the baby started to make my back ache.The best thing about this sling, besides the fact that the kids loved riding in it, is that it folds up into a reasonably size bundle that fit in my diaper bag. So as the kids aged, and wanted to walk on their own I could just toss this carrier in the diaper bag for when they got tired. Also with the kid riding either in front or on your hip, they are very accessible, so that you can hand them something, like a bottle or a bit of food when you are on the go. (Say like walking around at the Zoo.)I must admit I liked the hip carry position best, it mimic\'s having my arm under their butt, and holds them close.Anyway its reasonably priced, you\'ll get your use out of it, (unlike the front only carriers, which as I mentioned aren\'t good for very long, or the backpack carriers, which while are good for that heavy load, don\'t pack up and so aren\'t with you when you need them.)",5
"Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim","My Grandson is super fussy and I used this for my own son. Put my Grandson in this turned on the vacuum and he was out like a light! He looked just like he was back in the womb!Thank goodness I still had this as it is no longer available. What a great product!",5
"Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim","Every time I hear a parent say that they tried a sling, but baby hated it, or it was a pain, or they just ended up not using it, this was the sling they tried.  People who love their slings used a Maya Wrap, Over the Shoulder Baby Holder, or New Native sling.  All of which come in great fabric choices and are easy to use.",1
"Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim","I am the the mother of a 14 week old who has reflux and is uncomfortable sleeping in a crib or anywhere flat. She wants to be held *all* the time, and it was getting pretty exhausting in our arms (and my chronic tendonitis was flaring up) until we ordered the sling after reading about it in Dr. Sears\'s The Baby Book.  I had my doubts, but boy has it been a lifesaver!The sling has been invaluable for me, my husband, and our regular sitter. With it, we are able to walk, bounce, give the calming pinky finger treatment, and see what\'s going on with the baby. She started using the sling at 2 weeks, when she was about 7 pounds. It took a few times, but she is now completely comfortable in it and it is a favorite napping spot.As I am large-breasted, I did find it awkward to breastfeed in it, although I\'ve been able to do it successfully a couple of times in public sitting down.  The fabric is soft and easily washable (important for those baby mishaps).  The padding helps me feel comfortable as a bit of protection in case of bumping.  The size is very adjustable for different height people, although you may need to pull through a lot of fabric to bring small babies in tightly, especially if you have a smaller chest size.The NoJo sling would benefit from having some loose fabric at the end to cover the baby\'s head in the sun and provide more coverage during breastfeeding. The stopper piece of plastic at the end of the fabric adds safety (it won\'t pull through), however it can whack the baby if you aren\'t careful when getting it on or off.  It could also use a zippered storage area, a feature of some other slings.  Also, the blue with plaid seems to be the only fabric sold these days, although I have seen other patterns and colors on eBay.  This is fine with jeans, but not great when you have to go to a wedding, as I did with the sling earlier this summer. I think it also makes people think that she\'s a boy, for some reason.  Maybe it\'s the blue and the fact that they can\'t see her cute dresses!The sling is also helpful in keeping interested strangers at a slight distance away from the baby -- they are less able to grab at her, which I think is good from a germ perspective, especially for newborns. When it is very hot or humid out, this sling can be a bit heavy for the baby (especially up against a hot mama!), but on cooler days the fabric adds just the right amount of warmth, like a light blanket.When I was pregnant, I assumed the Baby Bjorn would be all we would need. Instead it hangs on a hook most of the time unless we\'re going for a long walk or shopping -- activities where having two hands is important and you\'ll be doing them for a while. That thing is so hard to get on and off! Plus, you aren\'t supposed to use it until they are 8 lbs. The baby seems to really like the flexibility of positioning with the sling -- especially curling up happily in a womb-like ball -- and sometimes gets irritated by being all dangled out in the Bjorn.Carrying the baby in the sling makes you so much more mobile than using a stroller or lugging her around in her heavy carseat, so I use it whenever I anticipate being in public where they are stairs, space issues, or other impediments.  It\'s good for short shopping trips as well, especially if you\'re with a friend who can carry things or push a cart, both of which are harder to do with the sling on.She\'s also a million times more comfortable in the sling than in her car seat, where she often cries.  Our NoJo Babysling has been in constant use since it arrived, and ties the bouncy seat (where she mostly sleeps by day) as the best return on investment of any of the baby gizmos we bought.  Our sitter will often wear the baby for her entire nap. The sitter just sits (often in a rocking chair or porch swing to provide some more movement) and reads while the baby sleeps.One last thing that\'s great is that when the baby falls asleep, she can be laid down on the bed or bouncy chair and the sling just slips off the wearer without waking the baby.I did not watch the video, but did read the sling chapter in the Baby Book, which was helpful. We have recently started using the kangaroo (facing out) position as the baby loves looking at the outside world now. It\'s nice to have this sort of flexibility.  If you are getting tired carrying around your baby, and would like an extra hand free, a sling is a great investment and while not the most elegant, the NoJo is a good workhorse one to use on a daily basis.",5
"Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim","I love Dr. Sear\'s books, but this baby sling is much too large!  I am a slightly small framed 5\'5"" woman.  My 6\'5"" husband wears this sling just fine.  But, for a sling to work for YOU, it MUST FIT properly!  I finally bought a sling that fit me when my son was over 1 year old.  I couldn\'t believe what a difference it made and felt so sad that I hadn\'t tried a different sling sooner. My son loves sitting in it on my hip and brings it to me whenever I am working in the kitchen. Try the Rosado sling or any other brand that comes in sizes and buy the size that fits your body!  You will really be able to enjoy the baby wearing experience that Dr. Sears recommends so highly!",2
"Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim","I think slings are some of the most useful items for babies. They make nursing so easy, even while walking around on the street or in a busy store. I love the Sears Library, so I thought the Sears NoJo sling would be great. While I did use it for a long time, and would still recommend it over a front or back carrier (at least for the first few months), I found that this sling was difficult to adjust and my baby seemed to disappear in the first month or so. For small babies I prefer a sling with no railings, and more adjustable. The New Native sling and many others offer this. I would shop around online, there are many better slings than this.",3
"Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim","We purchased the Babysling when our daughter was 2 weeks old.  I was looking for a baby carrier that I could wear while nursing her that would be comfortable and discreet.  Initially, I found the sling very awkward to use.  I wasn\'t able to master nursing her in the sling until she was 2-3 months old.  However, as a carrier the babysling was great from the beginning.  Our daughter was colicy, and being able to put her in the sling all cozied up to either myself or my husband, hands free, was a God send.  This calmed her 90% of the time.  As the months went by, being able to wear her in the sling enabled me to get housework done without baby crying to be picked up - she was already up, and was able to be &quot;involved&quot; in my daily activities this way.There are many different ways to wear your baby in the sling, and that versatility has made it one of the best baby product purchases we made.  Our daughter is now 2 1/2 (30+ lbs.), and when she\'s having a rough &quot;toddler day&quot; will still occasionally ask for the sling.Be patient with the sling.  Practice with it, and if you can, find a friend who has used one successfully.  Dr. Sears also has a whole chapter on using a sling (any sling, not just this brand) in his book The Baby Book - great photos in there to help get the hang of things.One last remark... I have a friend who tried this sling and was unable to get it tight around her body (she\'s very petite).  There are other brands of slings (Maya Wrap, Over the Shoulder Baby Holder) that come in multiple sizes that might allow for a more customized fit.",5
"Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim","This sling is the third baby carrier I purchased, when the first two highly-promoted products were too uncomfortable.  My son was a premature baby who needed to be carried a lot for the first few months.  After we purchased this sling, my son basically lived in it!  The variety of cozy positions were perfect for his needs, and the sling fits so comfortably on both my husband and me that we don\'t even feel the weight of the baby when he\'s in it.  In fact, the weight of the baby is so evenly distributed that you don\'t develop the shoulder strain or lower back sway that other products gave us.  We would recommend this sling to anyone with a newborn or premature baby, and we continue to use it now that our son is a big 6-month old baby.  Buy it!",5
"Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim","I got a regular carrier as a gift and I hated it! The baby would slide down in it, even though it says its for newborns. I have two other children and had to attend open house at two different schools. The first open house I had the baby in the carrier and it was awful. I ended up taking the baby out of it. My breastfeeding consultant told me about the sling an I went out and brought it right away. It is the best thing I could have ever got for myself and baby. The second open house was so much easier. The baby just bald up like in my womb and slept for the whole two hours. It was also great because I had both hands free to meet and greet the teachers. It comes in handy for breastfeeding discretly in public which for some moms is a must. The baby would sometimes get upset when taken out of the sling. I would recommend the sling to every mom every where!!!!!!",5
"Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim","My neighbor had the Nojo and liked it so I was going to get one too. I tried hers, but I couldn\'t get it tight enough so my baby hung down too low which didn\'t seem safe and hurt my back. I thought I could order a different size, but found it only comes in one size. I then read all the reviews here and followed someone\'s advice and ordered a from babymoon slings. It fit me better (I\'m petite) and was a lot easier to use (and prettier!). I think it makes a big difference to get a sling that\'s not bulky and comes in sizes - I don\'t get why they use so much padding in the nojo, it makes it really hard to use with a newborn compared to other slings.",1
"Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim","I have four children and have seen the benefits of the sling first-hand in varied situations.  My first was very small, and as a newborn, I thought he seemed lost in the sling so I exchanged it for a front-pack carrier.  Now I know that you can put a blanket or such in the sling to help cradle a newborn more securely.  It was a lost opportunity for us.  With the arrival of my second child, I decided to give it another try, as many of my friends raved about theirs and I\'d need my hands free for my first child still.  I found the sling to be great for nursing, and afforded me privacy when I had to do so while out and about as I could pull the sling\'s fabric right over the baby and cover us both.  For a tired baby, it is much more conducive to sleeping than an upright carrier, and you can slip out of it and lay the baby down while still in the sling, if necessary.  My third child was (and still is) very cuddly, and enjoyed being next to me.  Since a mom\'s arms tire after a while, I found the sling a great way to incorporate baby into my routine without wearing myself out.  My fourth child turned our world upside-down with a very colicky start.  The &quot;insert-in-sling-and-go&quot; method was the only way to settle him down.  I could nurse, cook supper, do whatever I needed to do while keeping him close and moving, which was the key.  He learned to relax and even sleep while I was doing all sorts of things and making quite a racket at times.  Now at nearly three, he\'ll fall asleep while I\'m driving and I can take him into the house, remove his coat and shoes, then carry him upstairs to bed without disturbing him.  I believe his learning to relax and sleep in the sling with so much going on around him has helped him in this area, too.  Most of all, it is just nice to have that close time with your little one in the sling, even if you are busy with other things to do.  I can\'t promise miracles, but this sling has been a crucial part of our early parenting and I recommend it highly!",5
"Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim","I bought this babysling after reading about it in Dr. Sears\' book.  My daughter was 2 months old and fussy!  Nothing seemed to work.  I was desperate!  Since the babysling was adjustable I thought it would fit all body types...not!  I am of average height but on the slimmer side.  It gave me alot of shoulder and back pain.  I rate this a one star because I found one use for it...I use it tied around my torso to carry my daughter on my back with the slight support of my hands. Back carrying is a bit tricky so don\'t try it alone!  I think baby slings are great but not this one is not for me.  If you are slimmer than average, try the New Native baby carrier.  It\'s portable and comes in different sizes.",1
"Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim","I disagree with all of the reviews that say one size does not fit all. My Husbad is 6&quot;4 I am small frame 5&quot;2 and all we had to do when switching was move the adjustment. It was quite easy. We bought this after having the others. But they spread our daughter legs too far and she wanted to lie down at times not sit up. It was great because she could sit or lie down. And when she was very fussy it was the only way to get her to sleep. We then just slipped it off and put her down. IT was Great! Now that she is older I no longer use it but it was such a life saver I could not bring myself to get rid of it.  I not only recomend this but Dr. Sears book to anyone who has a fussy baby.",5
"Arm\'s Reach Co-Sleeper Original Bassinet, Solid Toffee","I love the idea of the co-sleeper. I\'ve seen some other concept designs by other companies and I hope they follow through with them. Arm\'s Reach has a bit of a monopoly on the co-sleepers right now. My little one hasn\'t arrived yet, so I haven\'t actually used it yet. Assembly is REALLY confusing. I don\'t know what happened to my paper instructions, but I can\'t find them. Luckily, there are some on the AR web page. But it is still so confusing.For those of us who are ardent Attachment Parenting, this is ideal. My older son, 15 months old, is still in bed with us and this Arm\'s Reach will give us the extra space for two little ones. We used the Snuggle Nest when our older boy was a small infant and that worked great. With two though, I wanted to keep the older away from the younger while they slept but still near us.If attachment parenting is a new concept for you, I strongly encourage you to read as much as you can online.

It would not stay upright when my daughter played with it.  And it had a removable piece in it.  Needless to say, it was not a piece my daughter at the time knew how to put in and out.  And on top of that, she decided that she\'d rather play with the removable plastic piece than the toy itself!  Also, my stroller would not fold up with this on (oh yea, my stroller is a name brand stroller too).  I would have to remove it everytime i folded it up.

I had no idea the ladybug on it was a snack holder, I wouldn\'t be putting anything in there, The stroller I have the Tray comes off so I just put the toy on it without the tray. but it the straps do loosen up on it, so I am every once in awhile Straightening it.I do reccomend the toy to anyone who has a baby like my daughter! i\'m very happy with the toy!",5
"Sassy Busy Bugs Bar","I bought this toy for my son when he was able to sit in his stroller.  I to have the Quattro Tour travel system and although I can make it fit by tighting the velcro staps it never stays straight.  I always have to keep spinning the toy around so my son can reach the toys.  Also, two of the pieces already broke off of the bar within two weeks of having it.  I give this product 3 stars because my son did like to play with it but, thats really the only good thing.",3
"Sassy Busy Bugs Bar","I bought this on a whim to keep my 4 month old happy in his stroller.  Otherwise, I would be holding him while pushing the stroller!  Well - he is now 9 1/2 months old and STILL loves it!  He bites on the wings of the bee and chews on the bug attached with fabric.  He doesn\'t ever seem to tire of this toy and I\'ve been on marathon shopping sessions with him lasting a few hours!!  I would recommend this to everyone as one of the must haves for under 12 months!",5
"Sassy Busy Bugs Bar","I bought this for my son when he was 4 months. He is now 11 months and is not that enthused with it anymore. I liked this product because of the bright colors and the variety for him to play with. It is a very good toy, but my son doesn\'t have much interest in it. Nothing at all wrong with the toy, I would recommend it to anyone.",4
"Sassy Busy Bugs Bar","This toy is very cute and I personally love Sassy products but I found this to be a hazard as well as a waste.  First of all the butterfly hits my children in the face and has hurt their mouth as well not to mention it does not fit properly on a stroller.",1
"Sassy Busy Bugs Bar","This toy is so nice to have if you use your stroller a lot. My baby has loved playing with this and I have even given this as a gift. The only thing that I did not like was that the cup that is the bugs legs, comes out. That is great for cleaning but if the baby takes it out, it can become yet another thing to keep track of during your ever so busy outings. Overall, this is a great and cute idea and gives some added fun for babies stroller time.",4
"Sassy Busy Bugs Bar","We have this stroller bar and it ABSOLUTELY fits on the Graco strollers!  We have the Graco Quattro Tour system and this toy bar has been on it since we took my son out of the car seat carrier.  You need to put the velcro on off to the side and then slide it on to the main section of the snack tray.  It takes maybe 1-2 minutes to attach and then you never need to touch it again.  My son loved to look at it when he was 4 months and loves to play with it now that he is one year old.  The only complaint that I have about this toy is that the snack cup bug comes with an insert that is supposed to look like legs when the cup is closed.  It tends to fall out so i just took it off the toy.  Other than that, this is a great product and will occupy your child during long stroller trips.",5
"Sassy Busy Bugs Bar","Baby loved this but the only problem is the straps that tie it to the stroller are not big enough for some trays. Due to this my first one came un-sewed and I had to buy another one and the same thing happened again.",3
"Sassy Busy Bugs Bar","Once my daughter started teething, the paint started coming off &amp; it was only when we found some on her lip that we realized.  We have not used it since &amp; had only been using the bar for a couple of months.I worry about such things as \'paint eating\' &amp; consider the possible risks to be too concerning to rate this product any higher than 1*.Best wishes.",1
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","Ok - newsflash.  Diapers are just smelly.  We\'ve had this pail for 2.5 years now.  It was our first and primary one.  There were no major smell problems until after one year, when our son started eating solids.  Also, we change the bag twice weekly as 3 days is about the max for smell-containment.  Around 20-22 months we started shopping for a container that would be less smelly and didn\'t find one as good.  (We have a cheaper one upstairs which broke immediately and always stunk!)  We finally just put the Diaper Champ in the attic a few months ago and use the cheap one with the flip-up lid - mainly since the cheapo fits inside the cabinet and we didn\'t notice a big difference in smell-control.  (The most helpful action is to tie the dirty diapers inside a small plastic bag before putting them in the pail.)A couple of our friends have this pail and were pleased until the children started eating solid food and things got stinkier - but that\'s pretty much the consensus according to many reviews on the different pails.  I\'ve knocked off a star since the mechanism isn\'t that intuitive (to grandmothers and babysitters, at least) and it frequently gets stuck when the bag starts getting full.  Plus there are some smell issues, as with any pail.  However, the fact that you can use regular trash bags is so much more convenient!",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","This is a good product to start and very easy to use.  But as baby gets older and begins solid foods, it is not effective as an odor controlling pail.  It is simply a place to put dirty diapers.  My daughter is now 10 months old and we had to remove the Diaper Champ from her nursery because it smells too bad.",3
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","My husband and I selected the Diaper ""Champ"" mainly because you can use ordinary trash bags and not be roped into buying the specialty refill bags, and it was moderately priced (a little less than the Diaper Dekor). It also seemed that the reviews of this product were generally more positive...The positives are:1. You can use any trash bag2. Easy to use and refillThe negatives are:1. The bag doesn\'t seal around the dirty diapers, so when it comes time to refill the bag, it\'s just like opening a regular trash can. Smells like the Champ is trying to knock YOU out with odor!2. The plastic seems to smell, ie. You put a dirty diaper in the hole, and flip the handle to dump the diaper into the champ. That ""side"" of the plastic dumper-thingie is in contact with the air inside the dirty diaper changer, so when you flip it over the next time to dispose of another diaper, you smell the last 8 diapers you put in there...pretty gross.3. The ""odor seal"" (some soft material) really seems to retain odor. It cannot be washed or replaced, so after a while, the Diaper ""Champ"" smells even when freshly washed and deodorized (I\'m talking about hosing down outside and scrubbing with Clorox cleanser!). Super-frustrating! This is my primary complaint.Okay, so some things are a given as far as disposal systems go (ie. *some* odor, must empty frequently, must wash and disinfect occasionally), but still I think this product leaves much to be desired.We\'re going to try another disposal system.",1
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","Excellent diaper disposal unit.  I used it in conjunction with Glad 3ply kitchen trash bags with odor control (scented).  I am soooo pleased with this product!!! A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","We love our diaper champ.  It is very easy to use just drop the diaper in and flip the top over.  No need to stick your hand inside.  No hint of an odor, even when you are putting another dipaer in.  When it gets full, just put in a new trash bags.  The best feature of all is that even the most curious little ones can\'t get into the diapers.  Before we found the diaper champ, we had another diaper pail and our son learned to open it and pull the diapers out.  That is no longer a problem!!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","Two girlfriends and two family members put me onto this diaper pail.  They each had tried the Diaper Genie and had horrible results with eventual smells, and costliness of buying proprietary DG cartridges.  My family members eventually started bringing every dirty diaper out to the trash and leaving just wet diapers in the DG, that is until they found out about the Diaper Champ!Wow, what a difference, it seals in orders very well and using normal 8 - 13 gallon trash bags makes it economical.  The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child\'s point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.  Also, it needs to be away from the wall a little bit, so that it\'s flip top access lid locks into place and doesn\'t plop back down, but when engaged, the top will stay open so you can get at the bag of diapers within without having it fall onto your hand.We keep a little can of Oust nearby, spritz it before opening the top, grab the bag at it\'s neck to close off stinky odors, lift it out, twist it at the top and secure it with a twist-tie, and away we go to the garbage can.  And we take antibacterial wipes and run them around in the plunger area on both sides, voila, it\'s clean.At 3 months, we change the bag about 1 - 2 times a week.  Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that\'s better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I waited to review this until I saw how it performed in the really-stinky-diaper stage.  Now, with my daughter at 1 year and eating lots of solids (and making really stinky diapers), I can happily recommend the diaper champ.  A couple suggestions: 1) as baby\'s poop gets stinkier, empty more often (at least once a week) and 2) every time you empty, spray with Lysol or similar product and wipe out with antibacterial cleaner.  This second step has kept the plastic from retaining a bad smell.I gave 4 stars because it\'s not ""perfect"" -- sometimes a little smell leaks out if it\'s very full.  But all around a good product, and not needing special refill bags is a huge benefit for a busy mom.",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I have had a diaper genie for almost 4 years since my first son was born and I have been using it with my second as well.  I thought I\'d try the champ to save $ on the genie refills.  Well it is not a $ saver because it does not hold the odor inside so I was constantly changing the trash bags.  The diaper genie is not odorless, but it does a much better job of keeping the room fresh smelling for a longer period before you have to empty it.  The champ is just like a regular trash can with a lid-just looks fancier.  I suppose you could use it as a regular trash can in your child\'s room-they wouldn\'t be able to get into it!  Don\'t waste your $ to ""save"" $!  Buy the genie-your nose will thank you!!  Also, if you don\'t keep the dirty wipes enclosed in the diaper, they get this thing all dirty and you have to clean it! YUCK!",1
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.  I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn\'t like the idea of having to buy special bags.  Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!! I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM!No one has ever come to my house and noticed \'diaper odor.\'  In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son\'s diaper have been amazed at how the very \'potent\' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!  I change mine about 1 or 2 times a week.  For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!! Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!!  Hello, it does house dirty diapers!! All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.  SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn\'t as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful.  Again, this is because as their diet changes, so does the consistency and odor of their stool, in other words, it gets stinkier!!!All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I am so glad I got the Diaper Champ instead of the Diaper Genie!  You can use pretty much any plastic bag - even a grocery bag will do in a pinch.  My baby is 6 weeks and I have never smelled any odors at all from the Champ.  I especially like the way you close it - you just flip the handle and that\'s it.  The Champ is definitely the best.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","We had 2 diaper Genie\'s both given to us as a gift but it was hard to use it since everytime you stuff the diaper in you have to turn it which cannot be done with one hand (required if you are holding your baby).  Also everytime you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing.  On top of that the refills are very expensive.  So we decided to buy Diaper Champ and so far we love it.  It is very easy to use with one hand.  I like the feature that you can acutally clean the chute if for some reason it gets messy.  Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.  It is very easy to use and does not smell unless the bag needs to be replaced and the most important part is that you can use your regular garbage bags (no need for expensive refills).",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","When shopping around for a diaper pail I was drawn to the Diaper Champ for several reasons. 1) I loved the idea of using regular plastic bags from the grocery store. 2) The one-hand chute is quick and easy to use while dealing with a squirming baby. 3) I\'d heard negative reviews about the Diaper Genie. Now that I\'ve had the Diaper Champ for 8 months, I\'m looking for a diaper pail that lives up to its name.About 2 months ago the chute began to stick and the pail began to release unpleasant fumes each time I\'d drop a diaper in. The inner lining had come loose and was preventing diapers from dropping down into the bag. Eventually, the lining just fell out and that\'s when the smell became unbearable. Not only is my daughter\'s nursery filled with odors strong enough to give you a headache, the smell is seeping into the hall and down the stairs.Our Diaper Champ is on its way to the recycle bin. It won\'t be returning for a come-back fight.",2
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","This is the very best. So much better than Diaper Genie. No doubt about it. I would never buy Diaper Genie again. As a matter of fact I threw them out. Here you have No Refills to buy, much easier to empty and put in a new garbage bag, a lot cheaper and most of all a lot quieter. The Diaper Genie is so loud when putting in a diaper in the middle of the night that is a pain. I highly recommend this product. In regards to smell?.....excuse me there are diapers in there, not roses. Like the lady below said a Clorox wipe with some Lysol and your set to go. If you\'re still picky put in an airfreshner.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","We bought this pail because it used regular trash bags and hoped it lived up to all it says - IT DOES!!  We use the scented trash bags and have had no trouble at all!  (It does get a little smelly when you change the bag, but that is expected)The only thing we don\'t like is the inside lid that holds the bag down. It does not stay up on its own.  So when you change bags it has to be held open with 1 hand-leaving only 1 hand to get the bag out.  It just makes it akward.My husband even recommends it!!  So it has to be good.",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","While pregnant with my son I reviewed all the diaper pails and found the diaper champ to be the most reasonable.  I liked the idea of no costly refills and it was only a couple more dollars than the diaper genie.  It was easy to put together, however it is difficult to open and empty.  My son is now 13 months old and the odor is noticeable.  Even the pail itself stinks regardless of how often I scrub it ( I even use scented trash bags).  With dirty diapers you do have to expect some smell, I mean it comes with the territory, however I have to keep an air freshner plugged into the wall to help combat the smell. It worked well for the first few months, but now I end up having to change the bags before they are even half full, which really seems like a waste.  I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.",3
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I have not used this item yet for diapers, but as for my first inspection upon receiving this as a gift...I found that every time I moved the handle at the top, the unit wobbled due to the poor design- large at the top with a small base.  I noticed that some online stores sell a new and improved design that has a larger base at the bottom- I purchased the newer model and no longer have the wobble problem.",3
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","Diaper Champ or Diaper Genie? That was my dilemma when registering for gifts before my son was born. Lucky for me, I had my Mom with me. She runs a daycare and said Diaper Champ is the best by far and that\'s what I went with. The fact that you can use regular trash bags instead of special cartridges was very appealing to me. Now my son is 6 months old and I must say this thing is GREAT! The only time I catch any smell at all is when I change trash bags. I use those Glad trash bags that are scented to prevent odors and that makes a difference, too. it is very easy and covenient to use and I highly recommend it. The only thing you need to watch is the opening latch is a bit tricky (I broke a nail the first time I used it, but then I got the hang of it). I am glad for this, though, because if it\'s not easy for me to open, it won\'t be for my son, either.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! It is SO much easier to use than the Diaper Genie, (you need a PHD in poopy to figure out how to use the darn thing!) and it even takes the same bags as my kitchen trash can, shich is super convenient, and cost efficient as I can buy them in bulk.The only reason for not rating it a 5 star was that I did have one small problem with it. The foam gasket in the barrell which keeps the poopy smell inside the unit ripped somehow, and it got VERY stinky. HOWEVER, I contacted the manufacturer though their website, and received an email back the same day stating that this was unusual, and that replacement gaskets were on their way to me. They arrived inside of a week and after replacing, it works great again! (They even sent me extras should it happen again)I HIGHLY reccomend this diaper pail over ANY competitors, you will not be sorry!",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","Although I had a Diaper Genie from my first child, which I hated, I registered for this for my second.  I received very few items from my registry but this was by far the best gift I received overall. It is very easy to operate.  My 4 year old feels a part of the diaper changes because he can work it.  It keeps the smell out which makes mom and dad happy.  But, by far the best thing about the Diaper Champ is that it takes regular trash bags so you don\'t have to worry if [the store] will have the refills.  It is definately a people pleaser!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","Granted our 3-month old isn\'t producing really stinky diapers yet, but the Champ is much better than using a trash can.  My only issue is that its hard to flip the handle over using one hand - kind of a must when holding on to a squirmy infant.",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","We loved this pail at first. The mechanism seemed ingenius, and we appreciated that it took regular bags. But once our daughter started to stand up, that big white handle was irresistable to her, and before we even realized it, she started flipping it. That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you\'ll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers. Worse yet, they can slam a finger then hurt it seriously in their attempts to get it free by pushing the handle the wrong way. It\'s really pretty scary.You\'ll notice that the positive reviews here generally say ""I\'ve been using this for two months, and it\'s great!"" But once you have older babies, I\'d retire it pronto.",1
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I bought this for my church nursery room. At home we use the First years product, which isn\'t bad but not as good as this one.There are a couple of occasions that dirty diapers were left in it for a week but i didn\'t know because it didn\'t smell till I opened it to change the garbage bag.I think this is the only diaper pail that is cheap to use yet does the job well.Highly recommend.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I recently gave birth to my third child.  When I had my 1st 11 years ago, I got a Diaper Genie and it worked okay, but the stupid refills for it were so expensive that I soon gave up on it.  Not to mention that the ""sausage links"" of diapers it created were pretty gross and I still had to use a garbage bag to dispose of them.  With this baby, I decided to give the Diaper Champ a try.  I LOVE IT!  In fact, I am considering buying one for my church\'s nursery, after having to smell a pretty foul diaper from one of the other babies there.  I agree with any reviews that suggest using scented garbage bags, as it DOES smell pretty awful when you empty it, and I think the scented bags would help that a little.  So far I have had only a minor complaint, and that is that it can be a little tricky to open sometimes, but overall it\'s still a great product.  I would definitely buy this again and recommend to a friend.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","Our daughter is 13 months old and we\'ve been using the Diaper Champ ever since she was born. I highly recommend it because it\'s a great value.  However, there are a few things to be aware of which is why I only gave 4 stars.1. Make sure the grip part of the diaper is not loose when placed in the DC. My husband learned the hard way that the grips get stuck on the seal and the diaper won\'t drop into the bag.  Then you have to pull the diaper out and the grips slowly pull away the seal.  It didn\'t seem to affect the odor control, but it did make it difficult to move the handle/shoot back and forth.  The company does send free replacement seals and instructions if you call and ask.2. The unit is top heavy when it\'s empty. I learned this one the hard way.  When pulling out a full bag of diapers be sure to put your foot on the base to keep it from banging you in the shin as it falls backward.  Ouch!!3. No, the stink isn\'t completely trapped, but it\'s pretty darn close! The stinkiest part is emptying a full bag.  I found that putting a stick-up inside the lid has made it much more tolerable.",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","My husband & I had received a tip from another parent that this was the must have item.  I had always hated that the diaper genie had to have special bags, I was just going to get a regular garbage pail & use that.  That is until we heard about the Diaper Champ.I absolutely love it.  It is a complete life saver all around.  No special bags to buy, not a hassle to put together.  Comes almost all the way assembled out of box just attach to base & voila you are ready to start changing diapers.  A little tip to keep the odor down.  I wipe it out with antibacterial wipes a couple of times a wk, & I spray Lysol disinfecting spray.  Once a month I wash it out with a mild dishwashing detergent.  Also, to give it a little good smell I buy a 2 pk of stick-ups(.97 cents at Wal-Mart) & stick one in the bottom of the pail.You will not go wrong betting on this one.  It is a sure winner.  You\'ll save a lot of money by using this one.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I don\'t know how we survived the first year without the Diaper Champ.  My daughter is now 13 1/2 months old and we still have an odor free nursery.  It\'s very economical, too.  Using regular kitchen bags and holding more diapers than the competing diaper disposal system makes this quite efficient.A trick that was passed down to me from an experienced mom to control odor (again, yes, it\'s going to smell a little...you put stinky diapers in it!):  Place a Bounce dryer sheet in the bottom of the pail (before putting the trash bag in)and spray thoroughly with Lysol after each use.  I don\'t know why the dryer sheet works...but it does!  And if I don\'t change it out regularly (about once every few weeks) then I start to notice the smell.Recommended above all other diaper pails!  Price-wise the Diaper Champ just can\'t be beat.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","We originally had the diaper genie which we found to be a pain after the top broke off twice and all those replacement specialty bags we had to buy were getting expensive but not controlling the odors.  All that sausage shaped smelly garbage eeeewwww had to be put in another garbage bag just to get it out of the house!  My sis-in law had the diaper champ & I couldn\'t believe she even had any dirty diapers around...there was no smell!  We chucked the genie and bought the champ. It was so much easier to use...just roll the diaper into a little ball and drop into the hole on top, flip the handle and bye bye smelly diaper (my 16 month old can do it) And there were no special bags to buy, just the same regular garbage bags we used already in the kitchen. Experienced parents will understand and appreciate that it comes apart for easier cleaning for those times when it may become a mess.  We had a problem with odors after about a year of use so I called BabyTrend to see what they recommended.  They sent me these replacement sponge gaskets (free of charge) and we were once again odor free. Now on my 3rd child and almost 3 years later, I just called them again to get another set of replacement gaskets (again free of charge) they will be here in about a week.  THIS IS A GREAT ITEM and the company stands behind their product (even years later!)",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I didn\'t want to get the Diaper Genie because of the expensive refills needed to use the product.  The Diaper Champ uses 10 or 13 gallon trash bags (or you can recycle larger store bags to use in the Champ).  The mechanism doesn\'t let odors out and if you have toddlers that get into everything, they can\'t get into the Diaper Champ!  Opening the Diaper Champ is easy but could be an initial challenge for some but once you figure it out it\'s simple to open.  I highly recommend the Diaper Champ.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I wasn\'t sure which to get between this and the Diaper Genie. I am so glad that I chose this one. I love that I can buy the scented bags of my choice. It really holds in the horrible diaper smell. I love it and wouldn\'t trade it in for anything.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I chose the Diaper Champ over the Diaper Genie because of its money-saving feature of being able to accomodate most plastic bags with handles.  (The Genie requires use of their own bags.)  The plastic bags that work best are the larger kinds like the ones you get from Toys R Us or Ikea.  The plastic supermarket bags are a little too small.In regards to odor control, the DC has been successful for 3/4 of the year.  There is a noticeable smell during the summertime, so I\'ve had to change the bags more frequently on hot days or else face the consequence of suffering the aroma of baking poop.My only negative comment about this product is concerning the lid.  For those who take great pride in your manicured nails, ask someone else to open it for you.  Even though I have short, uncared for nails, I\'ve had a few bent nails from trying to pull open the lid.  Then, the next problem is that the lid doesn\'t open all the way (like a cigarette lighter).  It opens up to about a 75 degree angle.  This makes it inconvenient when you are trying to remove a stuffed bag of diapers.  Also, the underside of the lid has several plastic sharp juttings against which my hands would occasionally get scratched.  And, during the removal of the full bag, this is when you get the full blast of your little one\'s excretions (quite possibly 3-5 days worth of them), so hold your breath!Although there is room for improvement on this design, I haven\'t seen or heard of any other model that can do this job nearly as well for as reasonable a price.",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","Bad construction is my main issue. My husband assembled it and when changing the bag, you\'re supposed to open up the top head part which tilts back.  There\'s a little plastic tab that\'s suppused to slide in as your opening the top, but instead it get\'s cought so it allows the top to open up only partially. It may just be one defective item that somehow passed the quality control inspection, but I\'ve given up on diaper pails in general.  Talking to 1st time parents, I found out that almost everyone gets one, but almost everyone stops using them very quickly.",1
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I was very happy with the Diaper Champ for a long time. I loved being able to use regular garbage bags, changing the bags was easy, and easy to empty. Very simple to put the diapers in. We did have to replace the sponge ""gaskets"" twice before putting the Diaper Champ to the curb. Once our child was on table foods this diaper pail does not work anymore! Even with cleaning it and letting it air out for a day. It literally made the whole house stink!So out to the curb it went and got something else. There is absolutely no smell w/ the different diaper pail.",3
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","This is on my list of must haves.  The thing has been in my bedroom for 6 months.  Not once have I ever smelled an odor from this thing.  I love that I can use any kind of bag so I just buy those super cheap super flimsy tall size garbage bags.The only drawback, as with all diaper pails, is that as the baby gets bigger and the diapers get bigger, you have to change the bag more often.  Our baby is 6 months and we fill it about once every 36 hours.But still, I wouldn\'t trade it for the world.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","Diaper catches and jams in the well and that is particularly nasty when the diaper is dirty.  Also, it is impossible to get it 100% clean after such a jam, which causes the oder to persist.  I have given up and am now throwing my Diaper Champ away and getting something new.",1
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I love the convenience of not having to buy special bags.  I got my Diaper Champ as a hand-me-down from a relative, and it still works great.  There is no diaper odor in our nursery.  When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn\'t flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it\'s overflowing!).If you don\'t clean things, they don\'t smell clean.  This isn\'t rocket science.The only reason I\'m not giving it five stars is because I don\'t like the opening mechanism on the front.  But I can\'t think of any way they could\'ve done it differently that would be as effective.",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I\'ve been using this diaper pail for 2 and 1/2 years and I LOVE it.  I can buy inexpensive scented bags from the grocery store and I just use recycled grocery bags to wrap-up the poopie ones.  My son\'s room has NEVER smelled at all!I do lysol it every once in a while.  But that\'s all I\'ve had to do.When I\'m at friends\' houses that have the diaper genie, I\'ve been confused about how to use it.  No one has ever been confused about how to use ours.  Just put it in and flip.I have recommended this to all of my friends and family.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","It suprises me to read all of these reviews saying that the diaper pail stinks up a room!  DUH! It\'s full of dirty diapers.  Personally, we never had that problem too much.  The nursery smells a bit sometimes but I think you would have that with every diaper pail.We got this one because we use cloth diapers and don\'t want each one mummified in it\'s own cocoon.  I used this for my first two kids.  We threw it out when we moved but now that the third is here we are going to get a new Diaper Champ.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","Diaper Champ is great.  But just to let you know that I\'ve been breastfeeding and the poop doesn\'t stink as much as formula poop.  So I can\'t tell you if Diaper Champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell, but it\'s excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I registered for the Diaper Champ after seeing the reviews and I cannot talk enough about it. I just live it!!! It is odorless(so far) and very easy to use - and only with one hand, so you can SAFELY keep the other one on your baby. It\'s very easy to change the bags, which you can use any 13 gallons one - no expensive refills to buy!!!! I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","You really can not appreciate this device until you\'ve used it.No smell unless you don\'t empty it for a week or more. An airtight vault it\'s not....but it does what it\'s designed to do very well.Who doesn\'t take out the trash more than once a week ? Same concept with this diaper pail.- From a Dad of a Newborn who\'s thankful he ignored the negative reviews.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I am glad my friend told me about the diaper champ, because otherwise I would have gone in for the diaper genie. This is cheaper than the genie for one, and works just as well in terms of trapping odor. It is also bigger than the genie, and the best part is, you can use regular garbage bags in them. Isn\'t that just PERFECT? Love this product, and would highly recommend it to any parents-to-be.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","In reading some of the other reviews, I think it\'s all been said but I guess I\'ll say it again anyway.  :)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.  My husband and I tend to let it get to the point that we have to actually push the plunger down to get the diaper to go in and still the nursery is odor-free for playing or sleeping.  And I must admit, I have a 1 yr. old who eats everything under the sun and even when it comes time to change the bag, it\'s not that bad.  Tie it up fast and you\'re good to go. ;)  I will admit that it can be hard to open, but if it were easier, I\'d have dirty diapers strung from one end of the room to the other because of my busy boy!!!  I highly recommend the Diaper Champ!",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I Loved this product. It kept smell to a minimum and could use a regular size trash bag.  Highly  recommend.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","After 2 and half years I still can\'t get the smell out. Its been sitting outside airing out for 3 months now, I think thats where I\'m leaving it too. I love the concept of a diaper champ, but somebody do something about the smell, please.",1
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","This product meets all my expectations. The diaper champ is easy to put together. It keeps odors in the container. Most importantly it uses regular 13 gallon bags! By the way, keep a roll of these at the bottom of the container for that day when it fills up.  Depending on your use you could go for a week without emptying it out.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","This is the worst diaper pail ever!  It was great for the first couple weeks, but then it began to smell.  I cleaned the inside and outside with 409 again and again, but the smell would return with the first diaper I put in.  Then to make matters worse my 16 month old figured out it was fun to put toys in the hole where you put the diapers and try to flip it the way I did with his dirty diapers.  I had a Diaper Genie that broke and was hopeful that this less complicated diaper disposal system would work as well, but it does not!",1
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I purchased this pail about a year ago and found out right away that it will not control Ordor for #2 diapers.  My cat box smells fresher!  So, I used it for wet diapers only until I found that my now 1 1/2 year old son makes is own deposits...his toys!  Oh and by the time the pail fills up with wet diapers, those smell too.  The bag gets heavy and awkward to pull out if you don\'t have good upper body strength or a bad lower back.  So, the pail is now in our storage unit and we have a wicker basket with a lid (found free at a garage sale) lined with a garbage bag that sits on our deck right outside the sliding glass door. Diaper deposits are made there where it is easy to get too, the smell is outside and it can be emptied by my husband...outside!",2
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","This is my first baby so I have nothing to compare this product to. But I have heard horror stories of stinky diaper pails. My baby is now six months old and the only time I smell her diapers is when I change them and when I open the pail to replace the bag! I use the same garbage bags that I use in my 13-gallon kitchen trash can! It\'s so simple and user-friendly it\'s ridiculous! Put in a trash bag, old plastic grocery bag, yard waste bag, whatever; put down the top, you\'re ready to go. The top acts like a chute and whisks the dirty diaper away. When full pop the top (hold your breath), pull out the bag and put in a new one. No jamming or any other kind of technical difficulty whatsoever! And, again, no leaking smells. Don\'t waste your money on anything else!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","As new parents, we started out with the Diaper Genie because everyone told us that we just *HAD* to have one.  While the Genie did a decent job at keeping the odors inside (except when emptying it!), it was a pain in the neck for older family members to use (e.g. grandparents) and those refill cartridges start to add up after a while!A friend with a child the same age as mine showed me her Diaper Champ and I was thoroughly impressed!  Not only did it do a comparable job at keeping odors inside, it was extremely easy to use and did not require me to spend an additional [$$$] each month on refills.  We decided to go ahead and buy a Diaper Champ because our son was only 13 months old and we figured he\'d be in diapers for at least another year so we\'d be saving money after 6 months by not having to buy the refill cartridges.  Then when our twins were born, we were so glad that we had the Champ!  After all, we\'re already buying tons of diapers, who needs to spend another [$$$] a month on those Genie cartridges?!As for ease of use, my 3.5-year-old son loves throwing the dirty diapers away for me because all you have to do is drop it into the chamber and flip the lid.  It is super easy to empty it too.  And I\'ve found that if I use scented garbage bags and give the inside a quick spray with Lysol each time I empty it, the smell when emptying it is not as bad as it is with the Genie.I HIGHLY recommend the Diaper Champ!  And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you\'ll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I found this pail to be heavy without anything in it.  I found that it took up too much space.  I find myself using a regular small garbage pail and I don\'t smell any odors (and all of my windows are closed).  dislike the mechanism for opening this pail, when I opened this pail for the first time, I broke two of my nails, I tried opening again and it was still hard on the fingers and nails. My son is only two months and perhaps I need a diaper pail later on, but for right now, I am going to use a regular garbage pail.",3
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","Can\'t get the smell of rank diapers out of the top(cover) of the Diaper Champ. Any better models out there?",1
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","My husband and I love the Diaper Champ. It holds a nice amount of diapers,contains the odor and it uses your own garbage bags. The Diaper Champ is easy to use and to empty, it really is a wonderfully designed product.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","We originally registered and received the safety 1st pail- what a disappointment.  the latch never worked- we purchased this pail and what a wonder!  my busy toddler can\'t get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).  I have recommended this pail to all my friends and they love it as well!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I was told not to waste my money on a diaper pail because it didn\'t do what it claimed to do.  Finding out it was a genie diaper pail I read the reviews of the diaper champ and decided to try the champ.  I couldn\'t have spent my money any wiser. Their is never an odor and I always wait until it is completely full.  Convenience of not buying new bags is wonderful!!  This is great for my 10 week baby\'s room-Love it!!!!!!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","With my second child I wanted something better than the Diaper Genie which I did not like at all, it was smelly and impossible to do with a one hand action.  Enter the Diaper Champ! After reading all of the customer reviews here I decided to try it and everyone was so right.  I can put poopie diapers in this diaper pail and it doesn\'t smell at all! It holds a sufficient amount of diapers and needs no special bags, just regular garbage bags. I has an easy one hand action to deposit the dirty diapers leaving one hand free to hold the baby with. I am totally pleased with the Diaper Champ and hope everyone gives it a try, its worth the money!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","Let me just say, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!  I used the diaper genie from the time my daughter was born until the time she was 16 months.  That was all I could take.  Constantly buying expensive refills, emptying it every couple of days, juggling a wiggly baby while trying to open, lift, push, spin, and close the genie was just too much.  Then I was shopping at Babies R Us and in the STORE\'s changing room is the Diaper Champ.  It was easy, didn\'t smell, and used regular trash bags.  I was sold.After using the Diaper Champ for 2 months now, I am confident I made the right choice.  Yes, when it gets too full, you have to change the bag or the weight will get stuck (duh!).  Yes, if you don\'t wrap up the poopy wipies in the dirty diaper, you will have to clean poop from the chute (just wrap it up).  Yes, poop does smell (not like roses), but my daughter\'s room doesn\'t smell like poop because the Diaper Champ does a great job of containing odor.  You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.  It is fantastic!!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","This is amazing! We can toss tons of diapers (abouth 5 days diapers for a new born). And there is NO smell at all. I do recommend the following: Close well each diaper with the velcro, you\'ll be able to fit more diappers. And occasionally clean the tube where the diaper is toss with baby wipes, then toss the wipe. Somehow when you open the diaper champ to replace teh bag, you smell more wipes than stools!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","We wanted to have a convenient locking receptable for poop-laden diapers in our toddler\'s bedroom. While they do lock, they aren\'t convenient. Wipes get caught in the mechanism and you have to shake and bang it while trying to keep wriggling baby on the changing table. Poop gets into the chamber, and smears on the outside of the rotating drum, particularly when they get too full, which they do often. They\'re bigger than diaper genies, yes, but not quite big enough for a baby with a big appetite.This smearing problem, is, in my opinion, probably the source of the smell that others complain of. We have cured the smell by keeping handy a container of bleach-wipes, and frequently wiping thoroughly in and out of the drum. What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch. You\'d need to open the latch before starting the change, and close it after, but that seems easier to me than thumping and wiggling a diaper champ in the middle of the change. It will control odors better, and you won\'t have to be continually wiping poop off the outside of it.",2
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I wasn\'t interested in getting the Diaper Genie because those sausage baggy things were too much of a pain!  Plus they can get expensive when you\'re having to change your baby 8 times a day and you have to buy refills for it.  When I first saw the Diaper Champ and read what you needed for it and what it did, there was no question that I wanted it!  It\'s awesome!  When they say it\'s odorless, it REALLY is.  The only time you ever smell anything is when you open the lid to empty it and all the dirty diapers are right there.  You never smell anything when it\'s closed.  Plus, I like the fact that you don\'t have to buy refill bags for it.  It takes the plastic grocery store bags that everyone has too many of.  I recommend this for anyone who is looking for a very convenient and odorless diaper pail!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I checked out all of the available diaper disposal systems.  This by far is the best, no refillable special bags, no stink, and very easy to use.  It is great! Those exploding diapers for newborns can\'t even crack this.",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","This diaper pail has NO ODOR and is the perfect size.  I use normal 10-gallon trash bags from Target.  No complaints at all!  Very easy to use and seriously, you do not smell any poopy diapers!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I love the diaper champ for how many diapers it holds and the fact you don\'t have to buy special bags for it, but it doesn not keep in the odors. I feel like I have to change the bag more often so I don\'t know how much I\'m really saving by not buying the special bags that a diaper genie requires. I spray the pail after every use and have cleaned it out with bleach and it still smells. Great idea but it just doesn\'t work. I haven\'t gone back to the diaper genie yet...is there anything else out there that works?",3
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I was definately excited to have a diaper pail capable of keeping smells down and holding more diapers. I have two little ones under the age of two.  I was immediately disapointed to find that everytime I tried to filp the diaper into the pail, in the entire thing opened up.  I guess mine could be broken but I think its just poor design.  It also seems to be no better than the competitors at keeping diaper smells in the pail.  The plus is that it uses regular trash bags.",2
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I own both the Diaper Champ and the &quot;other one&quot;.  I have had the &quot;other one&quot; for two years now and cannot wait to get my toddler out of diapers so I can get rid if it.  I bought the Diaper Champ for my newborn and have had for 2 months and LOVE IT!  Easy to use, easy to clean, and I use tall kitchen garbage bags so emptying it is a breeze!  I wipe it out with Lysol Wipes everytime I change the bag and spray the openings with Lysol once a day and have zero odor problems.  Hint: I also put a dryer sheet at the bottom of the pail in the bag so it gets tossed every time I change the bag and a fresh one gets put in!  Enjoy this product - Wish I had known about it with my first child!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","This is absolutely, by far, the best diaper pail money can buy.  Never do we detect a diaper odor (and my husband has a very sensitive sense of smell and is usually very quick to complain about such things).  For those who say they have a problem with the Diaper Champ getting stuck...the ONLY time this ever happens to us is when the bag is full and needs to be changed.  We love that it uses regular kitchen trash bags, makes it much more economical.  We have not found that we need to worry about frequent emptying or cleaning.  We just leave the Champ to do its job until the mechanism begins to feel like it\'s getting stuck...then we change the bag.  For us this means about once a week.  Not only is the Champ EASY to use, it\'s kind of fun.  Before our daughter was born we really worried about whether the diaper pail we chose would be effective enough for us because my husband is so sensitive to smells.  But she\'s two months old now and we still just can\'t say enough good things about it.UPDATE:  My daughter is now 9 months old and we STILL love our Diaper Champ.  She\'s eating solid foods, diapers are smellier, but the Champ is still doing it\'s job.  We empty once a week and spray with Lysol.  Yes, there is an odor when changing the bag, but we take the bag directly out to the trash, spray Champ with Lysol, insert new bag and close the thing back up.  Everything is just fine after that.  We are so glad we have the Diaper Champ and cannot sing its praises enough.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","At only 3 weeks old, my son goes through about a dozen diapers a day.  We have the diaper champ in his bedroom and it\'s been great so far.  (We\'ll see once he switches to solid food and his diapers are a bit more stinky!)  It\'s so easy to use and you don\'t have to buy the special bags.  We\'ve used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.  One recommendation - get a can of Lysol and spray the diaper champ down when you change the bag.  Overall, I love this diaper pail and would buy it again in a hearbeat!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","We\'ve been using the Diaper Champ for about 4 months now, and have had NO problems whatsoever!  The design is absolutely ingenious and the fact that it takes regular trash bags is a definite plus!  We bought a box of Hefty Trash Bags with that odor patch to use in the Champ and we change the bag about 2-3 times a week, and we\'ve have had no problems with smell.  I usually wipe the Champ off with a Clorox Wipe each time I change the bag, but my husband decided to take apart the Champ a few weeks ago to give it a thorough cleaning with some bleach water, and he mentioned that the gaskets were looking worn out.  So, I called Baby Trend (Diaper Champ manufacturer) and they sent me to two new gaskets and two new piston rings (which I didn\'t even ask for) for FREE!  The customer service rep. even told me to call and request more gaskets and rings when we notice that the new ones start to wear out, usually after about 6 months.  Overall, I am very pleased with our purchase.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","My biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did...dirty diapes and soaked diapers.....I only noticed an odor one time and that was because I did not close thelid when I changed out the bag. No need for deodorizers.I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty...even did while daughter sleep and no noise! I use the scented bags and even if I don\'t no smell! This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","Thank goodness we found something better and easier than ""genie""!!This one works great, no difficulty loading bags or putting diapers in.Only reason for not 5 stars is a little odor escapes but in my opinion well worth the offsetting ease of use.",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","My baby is 1 month old now and we have been using the diaper champ since day 1.  It is ultra convient when you have your hands full with a dirty diaper and a kicking, squirming wiggle worm.  There has been no smell at all, and the champ\'s generous size allows plenty of diapers, which is important because it seems as though there is no time to do ANYTHING!!!  I would recomend this product to any and all people with babies.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I changed my registry from the Diaper Genie to the Diaper Champ after reading the reviews for the Diaper Champ online. I\'m very happy with it. Our baby\'s cradle is in our room so we keep the Champ in there with us. There are no odor problems whatsoever. I also love that you don\'t have to buy specialty bags for this pail.The only caution I give is to moms with long natural or fake nails...the opening latch doesn\'t release very smoothly. When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply. I have short nails but I can imagine long nails might get broken or fake ones snapped off if care isn\'t taken when opening the top.Also, the diaper disposal mechanism, which is great (!!!) since it really keeps the odor inside the pail, can be a little loud as it slides down into the pail, especially in the quiet hours in the middle of the night when you\'re trying to get baby back to sleep. Just be sure to dispose of your diaper(s) before putting baby down to sleep.I would recommend this product to everyone, even with these two very minor issues.",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I started off with the Genie but quickly realized that I had to keep buying the special, pricey Genie bags. The Champ is great, takes any appropriate sized plastic bag and contains stinky diaper smells well. A MUST have!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","you can use any ol\' bag with this. go to the dollar store and get some of those kitchen bags. they fit it perfectly. you put the diaper in the hold in the top, turn the handle, and pop. byebye poopy diaper! it can hold quite a few. we only need to change the bag once a week. it really does hide the smell. the diaper champ is the best!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","It works ok.  I\'ve had it for a few months - I bought it based on its positive reviews in baby bargains, but I\'m going to find something else.  The biggest drawback is that a couple days after emptying it, stuff starts getting stuck in the device so that you have to open it up and wrench poopy wet wipes unstuck...defeats the purpose of an airtight bin.I haven\'t compared it with other bins, so I couldn\'t say whether it\'s the lesser of evils, but hopefully there\'s something better out there for the job.",2
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","We have been using our Diaper Champ for 4 weeks now (trust me, newborns poopy diapers DO smell) and it has met all our expectations. No odor and easy to use!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","So far so good.  I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.  I am wondering how some of these reviewers are able to stand having kids?  Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.  I could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point, but this prduct seems to work very well so far.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I chose the Diaper Champ because you are able to use standard trash bags.  I hate to buy replacement items such as bags ( i usually forget).  I works great.  The only thing is when it is full it is full.  It is very difficult to squeeze anything else into it.  I have not noticed any lingering oder in the baby\'s room and would recommend this item.",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","Overrated, odor is bad. I changed to Gallon zip-locs, you can stuff a few diapers in a gallon zip loc and discard.  If you don\'t want the diaper smell don\'t get this.",1
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I\'ve never even had a problem with it.  There is no odor and I find it very convenient to use garbage bags.  The only thing I do is spray the inside with lysol once in a while.  Even when I change the bag, the only smell is the diapers.  Once they are out, the diaper champ really doesn\'t have a smell.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","We have purchased three diaper pails prior to this one. This one is a hundred times better. The other ones always had springs that broke or the lid wouldn\'t stay shut. The Diaper Champ has none of these problems, and it is nice to use regular garbage bags. It was a little more expensive, but well worth the extra money.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","The Diaper Champ was a great invention. No special bags and easy to use one handed. You just put in regular garbage bags (fits like a glove) and empty as you would your regular garbage. NO smells, NO Mess, NO problem. It\'s a must have!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","This is the only diaper pail we\'ve had and our son is now 2.  We use scented kitchen trash bags ($3-4 for a huge roll at Target) and that seems to improve it\'s olfactory-blunting performance even more.  For especially messy and stinky diapers, I\'ll pre-bag the whole bundle in a small scented bag ($1 for 100 at Dollar Tree) that I can rest in the opening of the Champ.This may seem like a lot of bother, but it\'s not!  I haven\'t even washed the Diaper Champ out or Lysol\'d it in 2 years.  Did I really just admit that?!?  We empty it no more than 2x per week, on average 1x per week.  If there\'s ever a smell in the nursery, it\'s from the dipaer\'s presence pre-Diaper Champ entry.I do wish the Diaper Champ people could find a way to have some button the parent can push to flip the handle while keeping the 1 hand operation.  My son likes to put toys in the Champ and we\'ve had several close calls when he was about to send a toy into the pail, never to be seen again (becasue who wants to retrieve it, let alone let their child play with it?!?).  Some simple child-proof mechanism would be a Godsend.Even with that said,  the Diaper Champ is a great product and I\'d recommend it to anyone!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","Works great - no smells.  LOVE that it uses regular garbage bags. Easy to change and keep clean. Great option instead of the Diaper Genie that requires special bags and is so wasteful since it wraps each diaper in plastic.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","We got the Diaper Champ as a gift and immediately fell in love with it.  I wish I had invented this product.  It is one of our Top 10 items to buy.It takes regular kitchen trash bags and is really quite good about the smell.  Now that we are introducing Isabella to more foods we are finding that it does not contain the smell as well, but better than anything else that we use.The only problem I run into this that it gets stuck on the inside from time to time at the worst possible moment -- stinky full diaper that needs to disappear right now!  I am pregnant again so these smells get to me.  Because of this problem I gave it 4 stars.It gets stuck from an occasional diaper sticky tab sticking to the inside .  When this happens, you have open everything up and it can get a little messy if the tab was stuck in the wrong placeWe also own a Diaper Genie which is 99% smell proof, but also has it\'s own problems.  I would only buy this one, even if money, space and smell were not an issue.",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","Like other reviewers, I put this diaper pail on my registry because I just didn\'t want the hassle of having to buy special bags--what happens when you run out in the middle of the night!  I liked the fact that you can use regular bags in this diaper pail... in fact I frequently recycle BabiesRUs bags by using them in the Diaper CHamp.  I have twins--so you can imagine how much poop goes into this pail and I\'ve never had a problem with smell (I\'ve been using it for two+ months now).  You just put the diaper in the hole... flip the lid and the counterweight pushes the diaper down into the bag underneath and its ready for the next diaper--then you flip it back.  The flip handle does get stuck sometimes... but only when it\'s TIME TO EMPTY THE PAIL!!!!  Some reviewers seem to think the pail should empty itself, but unfortunately nothing on the market will do that for you.  When you change the bag (which is incredibly easy to do) you can just spray the inside with a little lysol and then periodically wipe it out with a sponge and some bleach.  I\'d do that much even with the more expensive diaper pails and I\'d still have to buy expensive special bags.... You can\'t expect something that contains poop to smell like a rose or to be germ free without a little work on your part, but with the Diaper Champ you can have a smell-free nursery AND save money by using plain ordinary garbage bags (or recycled plastic bags!)",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I have a two month old.  I\'ve tried both the Diaper Champ and the Diaper Genie for two months now.Bottom line:If cost is important to you...get the Diaper ChampIf smell is important to you...get the Diaper GenieThe design of the Diaper Champ does not prevent smell as well as the Diaper Genie PERIOD.If you see a review here that touts that the Diaper Champ doesn\'t smell, then laugh at them.  They probably have a dog and think that it and their house don\'t smell because of the dog either.YES, the Diaper Genie costs more over the life because of their bags.  SO WHAT.",3
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","When our daughter was born we bought the diaper genie and it soon became another unused thing in our closet.  I found it so impractical, because no matter what it says it is never truely one hand operable.  And it takes so long to stuff and twist that the baby is neglected on the changing table for a longer period of time.  Also, it didn\'t hold very many diapers and was a pain to unload.  I would rather just walk each diaper outside!  So when we were pregnant with our son I told my husband that we had to go shopping for a new diaper pail and that\'s when we found the diaper champ.  I now give this at every baby shower I go to even if the mom-to-be has registered for the diaper genie!  I know she will convert to this one.  I have never had a problem with odor, and it is truely one hand operable, as well as taking less than a second to operate.  All you do is flip the handle over and you\'re done.  No need to push the diaper in with your hand (gross!) just let gravity do it\'s thing.  It is also very easy to unload and install a new bag.  Plus there are no special bags!  Not only a money saver, but no need to worry about running out.  I just use our kitchen trash bags, and they work great.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","After the first 6 months I would have been rating this diaper pail top of the heap.  Certainly not having to buy special bags is a HUGE advantage... and the hole is larger that the genie so you don\'t have to worry about the &quot;squish&quot; factor as much.The problem, and the reason others had a smell problem is that this pail has large foam washers and a foam pad in the top section that get rank after time.  Luckily we just called the company and they sent new ones and the smell went when they did, but it was a bit of a pain.  I still think it was worth it to buy this one!",3
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I have used my Diaper Champ for a little over a year.  I was taken in by the fact that I could use grocery bags instead of continually purchasing liner refills.  The Champ worked great for only a small while.  As your children grow, the Champ will be very little help in controlling odor, which is the sole reason I purchased a diaper pail instead of a garbage can.  I change the pail every two days, sometimes every day due to the odors it fails to control.  I have begun to individually wrap up each smelly diaper before putting it into the diaper pail.  Otherwise, my son\'s room would constantly smell.  I am reluctant to purchase a new diaper pail, but the hassle with this one is pushing me to it.  Consider the Diaper Dekor or Neat Disposal System instead.  I\'ve read great reviews on both.",3
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","Simply put, the Diaper Champ is much easier to use, less expensive, and most importantly, MUCH better at keeping those odors locked away when compared to the Diaper Genie.  Even the smell of my niece\'s ""soy diapers"" don\'t seep through this.  I have been thoroughly impressed -- even the nurses at the hospital where I had my baby recommended it.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I love my Diaper Champ. My son is 3 months old and we have had a great experience with it. It\'s simple to use and is cost efficient. The biggest plus to this diaper pail is that you can use any plastic bag you want. As far as some people saying it smells, I haven\'t had a problem. Once a week I soak it with Lysol and water to keep germs away. I highly recommed this product if you want a clean, simple, and convenient diaper pail!",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I agree it\'s better than the genie.  I own the genie and served us well.  But when I had the chance to use this product at Babies R Us store, I was so impressed.  It\'s very easy to use, and it seals out the odor as well.  I wanted to get this for our use, but my genie is still in good use.  Too bad, the champ came late, or we should have gotten this instead.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I love the diaper champ.  I registered for this item because I liked the fact that it takes regular garbage bags.  When it\'s almost full it tends to have a bit of an odor, but lysol takes care of that, and helps kill germs.  This is very easy to use and is simple to change.  I highly recommend the diaper champ.",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","This contains the smell and it uses regular bags which makes it the best product in its category.  However, I never use it.  It\'s so much easier just to throw the soiled diaper in a regular garbage bag and take the trash out often.  We take ours out daily - this product tends to make you lazy and by the time you fill it - YUCK!Save your money and just throw your diapers in the trash.",3
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","We bought this because we needed a first floor diaper pail.  And the Diaper Genie was a bit hard to use, so we tried this one.  While this is very easy to use (one-handed), after 36-48 hours, it smells really bad!!  So we have to change the bag in it very frequently.  Oh well, I\'d still recommend it.  You just may have to buy stock in air fresheners as well.  And we even bag our smelly diapers before putting them in.",3
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","love it because it uses the bags from the grocery store.  way cheaper than others.  have to change regulary (2 times per week) when the baby gets on solids though.",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I registered for the Diaper Champ after reading many reviews for several different diaper pails.  This is by far the easiest product to use.  There are no complicated bag systems and no special replacement bags.  I have not had the problem of having any oppressive odors leak out into the room.  The only odor was inside the actual diaper pail itself.  There is no such thing as a completely odorless plastic diaper pail since plastic absorbs odors, but just drop a couple of dryer sheets (Bounce or something similar) into the bottom of the diaper champ (not in the bag) and the odor disappears.  This product is easy to use and the bags aren\'t hard to change.  I would recommend this to anyone.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","My 8 year old yellow lab was able to get the top of the diaper champ off and get his head stuck in the canistar.  No one was home and he suffocated.  This could just as easily have happend to a small child.  There is no warning in the literature to prevent this type of horrible tragedy .",1
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I have no problems with my Diaper Champ.  It\'s great to be able to use regular diaper bags and I never have any problems with smell.  Definitely recommend",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","We are first time parents but have friends who have young children. We always try to get out of spending the night at their house because the diaper pail in the spare bathroom smells so bad. We took a strangers advice (no one we knew believed in a diaper pail that didn\'t stink) and we purchased this product. We couldn\'t be happier. At first we used it for disposable diapers which worked fine, but we were worried about how it was going to hold up when we started using cloth diapers. Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top. We did run in to that once, it means the diaper champ is full and you need to empty it.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I wasn\'t going to get a diaper disposal system because I knew I did not want a new baby and then worrying about making sure I had the proper garbage bags.  But, I found the Diaper Champ and love it!  It works well and I went to Costco and purchased enough bags to last until the babies in high school for under twenty bucks!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","This is by far the best diaper disposal system we have found. You don\'t need any special bags - we usually just buy a roll of 35 13-gallon bags from Target for 99 cents. Usually the odor is not really a problem if you change the bags frequently, but if you don\'t have a chance to change the bags just put a poopy diaper in a  plastic grocery bag before throwing it in the diaper champ. Your odor problem will be solved.I would recommend this to everyone.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it.  It sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all (and we live in the damp and humid South, where odors of all kinds are generally rife).  It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags, easy to clean, and most important, easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle.  As the bag fills, you may need to flip twice to ensure that the weighted cylinder has completely pushed the diaper into the bag.  For the first 9 months or so, we only needed to empty this once a week.  Now that our son\'s diapers are a little larger, they take up more space, and we empty twice a week.  We have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck (we always wrap them in the dirty diaper).  It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!Update (March 2005): My son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now, but the Diaper Champ hung in there till the very end - easy to use, no problems with odors, and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby :-)",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","This is a wonderful product.  One suggestion to the manufacturer--the blue piece that holds the bag in place--perhaps the mouth of this could be made bigger so that an 8 gallon trash bag actually fills up completely before you need to take it out.  Right now, it\'s only about 1/2 to 2/3 full before we have to remove it.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I did a lot of research before buying a ""diaper system"" (asked friends, read other reviews on amazon, consulted baby product guides, etc.).  There didn\'t seem to be a consensus on the best one out there.  However, I have been very happy with my Diaper Champ purchase - the stink is contained, the dirty diapers drop in easily and it uses regular kitchen bags (no special bags required like other systems).",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","The best feature is that you can use your own garbage bags.  This makes the investment in a diaper pail a one-time occurance!!  The Diaper Champ works by using a piston-type chute.  You put the diaper in the chute, flip the handle, and the piston slide the diaper down into the bag below.  Nothing fancy...nothing to break!So far, it has worked great.  We change the bags 1-2 times per week.  Yes, it is stinky when you remove the bag, but what do you expect?!  We did put an sticky deodorant in the pail to help.  I agree with previous reviews...you still have to clean the thing!!When comparing to my sister\'s Diaper Genie, this is much simpler to use and costs much less over its lifetime.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","This has been a fantastic diaper pail for us.  We went through a Diaper Genie with each of our first two children, and this third time, I\'m so glad we tried the Diaper Champ.  It has proven to be far better than the Diaper Genies.  Our baby is 7 months old now and eating solids, and the odors have not been a problem.  Not buying special bags has been great.  No twisting; no cutting; no blades to wear out.  Wish we\'d used this with our first two.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","As much as I hear you all on the Diaper Champ - it is fabulous - the SMELL factor is greatly reduced when you take the trouble to empty diapers into the lavatory first.  This is what you are SUPPOSED to be doing.  Feces should NOT go into landfills because they can carry bacteria and intestinal viruses which can filter into, and contaminate, groundwater and soils.  Very few people seem to realize this and it is disconcerting that so many people are posting about the wonderful smell reducing power of this contraption without realizing that they are using it INCORRECTLY!  Please be more conscientious!  Do your part and put the poop in the pot and help to preserve our precious planet for that little person whose bottom you are currently managing.",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","Baby Luke can turn a clean diaper to a dirty diaper in 3 seconds flat. The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into ""what diaper smell"" in less time than that. I hesitated and wondered what I REALLY needed for the nursery. This is one of the best purchases we made. The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend\'s house REALLY reinforced that!! There is no comparison, the chanp is easy and smell free, the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genieplus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn\'t any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I find this product easy to operate.  With any diaper pail you will have odor, but folding the diapers up and using the sticky tabs on the diapers to keep the diaper folded will help keep odor away.  We bought 2, one for near the crib and one for the main floor.  BRILLIANT idea...didn\'t have to run up the stairs just to throw the diaper out.  Another helpful idea...put used diaper wipes in the diaper before folding the diaper up...otherwise the wipe will sometimes get caught in the slider and leave poopies on the pail.  How often did we have to empty it?  -  twice/wk when he was 0-3 months...once a wk after that.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I decided to register for this diaper pail mainly because of the fact that it didn\'t require special bags.  My baby is now almost 6 weeks old and we are really happy with it.  You can use regular kitchen garbage bags and our nursery doesn\'t smell at all.  It\'s very easy to use.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I believed the reviews of this product, and bought it when my baby was an infant.  It worked very well while I was still breastfeeding, but once we started solid food, the smell was pretty bad.  Each morning when we went into his room, the whole place smelled like diapers.  Still, I resisted the diaper genie, because I didn\'t want to spend the money on the refills.  However, by 10 months, we had enough, and finally bought a diaper genie.  What a difference!!  The only time smell escapes is when we empty it.  To me, it is worth the price of refills not to have to put up with the smell.  If it is not worth it to you, just buy a regular garbage can--it will work just as well as the &quot;champ&quot;.",1
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","If you dont want the baby room to smell bad and do not want to worry buying special bags all time. This is the product for you.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","Easy to change bags.Stable when changing bags (others are not!!!) - won\'t topple over.REGULAR GARBAGE BAGSOne hand use.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I love this diaper pale and wouldn\'t dream of trying anything else.  It is great that you can use regular trashbags and not have to buy expensive cartridges.  So far it has done great on containing the odor and I like how easy it is to use.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","Worth every single penny and then some! I orginally registered for the famous ""Diaper Genie"" but was so thankful that my mother-in-law purchased this one instead after doing some research of her own. No special bags needed so I can use my every day kitchen trash bags when I need to empty and virtually no smell from stinky diapers- you can\'t beat that! I am even thinking of purchasing one for my upstairs as well. Definitely the best one on the market.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I got this for my daughter and I just think it\'s great. We have this in her room and I haven\'t smelled any ordors coming from it except for when you open it up to take out the bag. I also love the fact that you can use just regular bags. I know of someone that had a diaper genie and she still had a diaper in it from when her baby was born and she was about 2 months at that time. I\'ve found that when it starts getting alittle full just shake it to level the diapers out and you will be able to get more in there. I have also heard that some people put kitty litter at the bottom of the bag to help eliminate some of the odors, but I haven\'t had to try this yet. I would highly recommend this to anyone.",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I have to say I really like the Diaper Champ, with one exception-it is definitely NOT always odor free.  I have had to put it in the bathroom now instead of the baby room, because smells from &quot;stinky&quot; diapers will seep out.  I think the best advice is to wrap the really smelly ones in a plastic bag before putting them in. Another word of advice-keep a can of Lysol next to it to spray when you throw a diaper away. It can also be hard to open-I\'ve broken several nails on it.  I\'ve only had it a few weeks (I\'ve been using it for my toddler\'s diapers until my new baby comes), and I\'m hoping that the latch on it loosens up a bit with opening and shutting. Otherwise, it\'s great that it holds more diapers, and it\'s SO much easier to put the diapers in it than the Diaper Genie I had.  I don\'t need two hands for it!",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","We are cloth diaper users and were attracked to the diaper champ because it said it could be used for cloth diapers and it keeps the smell in unlike other diaper pails. We were so disapointed to find out that it does not hold a full laundry load of diapers and cloth wipes. Some of our diaper covers also got stuck in the mechanism and I had to take it apart with a screwdriver to avoid ripping the cover. Mine is now in a closet and I\'m using a regular garbage pail. If you are planning to use cloth, this is not the pail for you.If your are using disposables, I think this pail would be great since you can wad them up into a tight ball. It doesn\'t stink except when you open it to change the liner and it takes regular bags.",3
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","After reading the reviews and comparing with the diaper genie, I went with the diaper champ; mainly because it didn\'t require expensive refills. I love that i can use my own trash bags! I change the bags about 2 times/week and have not noticed any smells. I spray with lysol when changing the bags (hello, diapers are stinky and this still will require cleaning). Overall, highly recommend it!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I love the Diaper Champ. I fought with the Diaper Geanie throughout my first son. This is so much easier to use, the three year old has mastered it! Uses your own bags. Don\'t waste time with others.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I received the Champ at my baby shower, and continue to thank my sister for it. My son can really drop a load, and you would almost never know it once it is in the pail. We do basic maintenance, like cleaning it every so often and spraying Lysol to keep it fresh. We save SOOO much money buying 150 ct 13 gal garbage bags for about $5. My one suggestion would be to change the bags out more ofen then needed, though. It helps to keep the tunnel from getting stuck, and decreases the chance of unwanted oders leaking out. I highly recommend owning one. Good Luck!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","This is an excellent idea having the lid to dispose of diapers.There is no odor and extremely easy to use. Having one of these helps from needing to take out the trash daily for the guys!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","It is so easy to use. You never have to change any cartridges and you can use an ordinary garbage bag. I love it and we have never had any smell escape from it.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I love this diaper pail. Yea, if you let poopy diapers sit in it for too long and don\'t change the bag on a regular basis it will start to stink but  c\'mon its a bucket full of poopy diapers.As you child grows, or if you have older children watch out. The handle system fascinates  little ones and they find it amusing that they can put something in, flip it and it disappears,  which is good when it\'s a diaper, bad when it\'s,,, your keys.",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","This diaper pail is great. It is the third one that I have tried. I just wish that I had it 4 years ago with my first child. It is very easy to use. You don\'t need special liners or refills. A regular garbage bag works fine. I had the Diaper Genie and it didn\'t keep odors out. The Diaper Champ doesn\'t totally keep odors away, but it works just as well if not better than the others I have tried. The diaper champ is very easy to use. You only need one hand to ""operate"" it. My 2 year old loves ""helping"" out and can independently use it.",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","This is a great diaper disposal system, but from reading many of the negative reviews I think there are many individuals who did not bother to read the instructions. the bag goes through the hole in the blue retaining ring,  then gets folded over the retaing ring and locked in place, at no point should any of the bag be out side the pale and if the bag is put in place like a regular trash can it will not seal properly and you will probaly get a smell. I can not comment on the few reviews who had a seal falure for I have not had mine long enough.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I read many reviews about diaper disposals and decided on the Diaper Champ and am VERY glad I did!  I had only heard about diaper genie but had never used it until I was visiting my brother who had one.  Now that I have used both, I am even more certain that I like the diaper champ!  With the diaper genie, you have to push the dirty diaper low enough so you can then twist the lid (the whole diaper sausage thing).  I didn\'t know that until I used it.  YUCK!  Plus what a pain when you have a baby in your hand.  The diaper champ is much easier...put the diaper in the lid and then flip the lid from one side to the other.  Being able to use regular trash bags is what hooked me in but now that I have used it, I\'m sold!  There\'s no smell except for the brief moments when you change the bag.  Just keep a stick-up in the diaper champ, and you\'ll be fine!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","Let\'s face it.  This is a specially designed garbage can to hold human feces.  One cannot expect that it will be odor free.  Mine certainly isn\'t.  It is my fault, though.  If I emptied the bag more often, there would not be a stench.  But alas, I am lazy.  So when I do change the bag, I also spray some lysol.  Works for me.  I like it that you just have to flip the handle for the diaper to go bye bye.When I first got the product, I really hurt my finger trying to open the thing.  But that was my own fault.  I did not have it on the floor.  When opening the lid, step on the stabilizer ring at the bottom of the unit and it opens with ease.I too love that you do not have to buy special bags for this.  What a pain to have to remember to buy and then spend five bucks a pop on Genie bags.  Thanks, but no.All in all, I really like my Diaper Champ.  It\'s also taller than the genie which is good for me, I don\'t have to bend over so much to flip the lid.",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","i love this diaper champ..not only does it save money on bags cause you use whatever brand you want it is bigger so it holds more and i havent had a smell come out of it!  My husband liked it so much he wants to buy another one for the den just for regular trash!!!  Another nice thing about it is you can put other items in it besides just diapers, and unlike the diaper genie you dont have to push down and smoush the diaper to get it in.  Wonderful item!!  (as you can tell i have use the diaper genie with my first child)  totally recommend the diaper champ!!!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","This item is great, you can you any bags you want (unlike the diaper Genie)!!!!! It is great for the price!!!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","The Diaper Champ is difficult to use and does not contain the smell at all!!  After you turn the handle to bring the diaper down, if there are more than a few diapers in there, it gets stuck and you have to turn it a few times to get it down.  It smells pretty bad after a day or two, and this is after cleaning it with Pine Sol AND letting it air out!!The only advantage is that you can use your own bags, but what good is that if you are constantly cleaning it and spraying Lysol??",2
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","If you can love a diaper pail that is...  The Diaper Champ is EASY to use (one hand) and very sturdy.  No parts to break unlike the other leading brand.  It does a great job blocking odors and best of all, is compatible with ANY plastic bag.  Here\'s a tip:  Tie dirty diapers in grocery sacks before depositing into the Diaper Champ.  NO SMELL WHATSOEVER that way!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","For my first born I purchased the Diaper Genie. It worked out well for the first 6 months. As the diaper sizes got larger the harder it was to get the diaper to fit. It would squish out the sides, making a horrible mess! So I purchased the wide mouth size. More $$! The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie. SO in a search for something better than a smelly garbage can in our baby\'s room, we found the Diaper Champ.The Diaper Champ out performed the Diaper Genie, not once was the diaper too large to fit in the top of the unit and it was cost effective because it uses your standard trash bags!On trash day, we would open the top pull out the old bag, tie it up, throw in a new one, and out to the corner for trash pickup.Ten years and 3 more kids later, this diaper pail is still the Champ in our house!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I received my Diaper Champ at my baby shower for the birth of my first son 11 months ago. I use it faithfully every day and love the ease and convenience of only having to change the bag once a week! I love that you can use regular kitchen-size trash bags and don\'t need to purchase any special expensive bags. One thing you might want to be careful of, however...make sure you do not throw loose baby wipes into the Diaper Champ or else the flip mechanism can become jammed and after time will not seal properly due to having to pull out wipes that are stuck. I love my diaper champ so much, I have asked for a second one for my upcoming baby shower for my second son.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I am a second time mom who used the rival Diaper Genie the first time around and let me tell you that there is no comparison. The Diaper Champ is easy to use, easy to change and uses everyday garbage bags instead of the expensive refills. Besides myself, my husband and mother found the Diaper Genie very frustrating to use, changing the bags required quite a bit of time and energy, all the while smelling the stinky diaper smell. The Diaper Champ is not perfect, it sometimes feels as if it has filled up too quickly (i.e. maybe it\'s not big enough), and when you change bags you do get a whiff of bad smell, but the smelly time is very short in comparison. So, I would strongly recommend that you buy the Diaper Champ and not waste your time, money and patience with the other product.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","GOOD POINTS:Easy to operate and change.Less expensive to use than comperable products.Kept smell in for several months as other products did.We were unable to break it after 10 mos unlike competitors.BAD POINTS:Toddler kept flipping it back and forth and touching where we put the diapers.Did not keep room odor free after several mos of use.",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","Great size, we only change each week but after 5 months the smell started to seep through and the nursery after 8 months is smelling too much of diapers now, despite airfreshners etc.  If my baby used this as a bedroom, he sleeps with us I would have replaced this sooner !!  I even washed it all our in bleach but the seals must have gone as its just getting worse.  I like the size though and love the fact you just put the diaper in dirty and swing the top over.  One problem with this is when it gets full the diapers get stuck - thats not very pleasent too.Going to BabyRUs this morning as after 8 months I decided today is the day its ready totally for a new one.",3
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I am really disappointed with the Diaper Champ.  It worked great at first, but then the foam seal broke and it wouldn\'t contain the smell.  Babies \'R Us gratiously exchanged it for another one and it happened again.  I would say it\'s a product default.  We always made sure the tape was tucked in, etc., but the foam liner just kept coming out.  Plus, sometimes when the diaper was really heavy and big, like in the morning when they\'re soaked, it wouldn\'t fit in the chamber and turn properly, so we\'d have to jam it in there, gross!Otherwise, the champ worked well on odors and accepting diapers.  I\'m pregnant with baby #2 and will look into other diaper pails.",2
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","As a first time mother, I wanted to get the best for my daughter. I shopped around a lot, and asked a lot of questions. While at someone\'s house, I saw the Diaper Champ. It was one that I hadn\'t seen very much in the various stores I shopped in. I was immediately impressed by the ease of it, and the convenience of being able to use ANY bag!!!When I bought it, I didn\'t have a chance to show my husband how to use it -- but no worries!!! It is so simple to figure out how to use! My nephew -- a toddler, knows how to use it (without him being able to open it up!)I\'ve even recommended it to strangers in the baby stores!You\'ll love it!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I like the slim shape and that you can use regular tall kitchen bags with the Diaper Champ. BUT, it really isn\'t that great in controlling odor. Sometimes diapers get stuck in the ""flipping tube"" and then you have to open it and pull it out... what a mess! It isn\'t all that easy to clean either.",2
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","We\'ve now had the Diaper Champ for a little over a year! We love it. It\'s better for the environment than other disposable diaper systems and it really doesn\'t smell! I highly recommend it. Drawbacks: it doesn\'t hold that many diapers at a time. We have 2 in dapers and we changes it 3 times a week or so. It needs to be cleaned pretty often or lots of mold and bacteria start to grow (on the parts you can\'t see until you take it apart). Lastly part of the fabric/plastic material has ripped on part of it so it is a bit harder to flip back in forth when you  put new dirty diapers in! Overall, this is a great product!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","After Our Diaper Genie broke after 2 years, I was advised to buy the D. Champ. It was highly recommended by a new mom with an infant. Big mistake, her baby as well as most of the people reviewing this positively are using it with their INFANTS, so their diapers do not smell like that of a one or two year old toddler!!!!!!!!  The Genie does a much better job of masking the odors, Yes, it is more cumbersome in terms of changing out the plastic....but that I can live with.  The reason I gave it two stars is the ease of use with the Champ is superior....but I simply CANT LIVE with the stinky smell of diapers!",2
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","We put a Diaper Genie on the shower list for the first baby. We used it for 2 years and it was OK but we were fed up with it and I took a chance on the Diaper Champ for #2. After 5 months, we couldn\'t be happier with Diaper Champ. Here\'s a short list of the main reasons I\'d recommend this against diaper genie:5. Diaper Champ doesn\'t use expensive refills like the genie. We were going through 2-3 of those $5 refills a month with the genie. On the conservative side, say that was $120 a year in genie refills. With the Diaper Champ, I bought one big box of Glad Kitchen drawstring bags (150 bags) for $15 at the warehouse club. We change the bag 1-2x weekly. The 150 bags will probably last 1 1/2 -2 years, for $15. (The Champ box says you can use plastic grocery bags. Don\'t. They\'re way too small and don\'t hold enough diapers to make it worth the while.)4. The Champ holds a lot more than the genie. Less frequent emptying.3. The genie was a pain to empty and even more work to change refills. Emptying involves tying off the tiny little sausage tube bag, restarting the cut end of the refill. Pain. Changing the refill was just annoying. When the refill runs out, there\'s not enough bag to tie so you are stuck holding an open end of a dirty diaper bag. I don\'t need that. And at any change or refill, you have to find another bag to drop the sausage string of dirty diapers into. With the champ, I open the lid, tie off the drawstring bag and that bag goes straight into the garbage can. The new bag goes in as simple as a trash-can liner and close the lid.2. The genie broke after about 15 months. There are 4 little plastic prongs inside that hold the diaper in place while you twist the ring to seal the diaper in the bag. The spring on one broke and it never held the diapers well again after that.1. And my top reason why the diaper champ is champ: It\'s perfectly easy to use, impossible to use wrong. Whenever we had a babysitter or family member helping while we used the genie, we always took a couple of minutes to show them how to use it. We\'d come home and every time, they\'d gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in. No, it\'s not difficult to use or get right once you do it a few times but if you only use it once a month, that dial on top that turns the cutter is just to obvious to turn to ignore and impossible not to turn. Every single time someone got it wrong. So, the Diaper Champ. you drop the diaper in the open hole and flip the handle and it\'s gone. I can\'t think of a way anyone could do it wrong and most people who\'ve used it so far, don\'t need even the simplest hint from us on how to use it.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I love this diaper pail. It keeps the diapers from stinking up your room/house. I also love that I can use regualer old kitchen bags and dont\' have to fork over extra bucks for special bags. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that I wish that it held more diapers.",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I chose this product because unlike the Diaper Genie you don\'t have to buy replacement bags, just pop in a tall kitchen garbage bag which we all have in our homes anyway.  I have twin boys and this product works great.  I recommend spraying it with Lysol and letting it air dry in between bag changes.  This works for me.  It also holds a lot of diapers.  I highly recommend it!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I\'m SO glad that we asked the sales associate at Babies R Us for help when picking out a diaper pail.  We were going to get a Diaper Genie like so many folks do, but the associate showed us the Diaper Champ and how easy it was to use. All I have to do is turn the handle and the diaper goes down.  There\'s no twisting and no special liners to buy.  As far as smell goes, ALL diaper pails will smell if they\'re not changed often enough.  We don\'t have a problem with ours smelling as long as we change it every three to four days (which should be done no matter what product you buy).  When I got pregnant with my second child (they are only 18months apart) we bought a second Diaper Champ.  We also just purchased one for my brother-in-law and his wife for their new baby.  Before buying ANY other diaper pail, compare it to this one first.  You\'ll be amazed at how easy it is to use.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","Love it, love it, love it!  This lives up to the hype.  You cannot smell diapers-unless of course you don\'t change it or clean out.  You can also use any trash bags you already have around the house, which is why we purchased this particular diaper pail.  It can be hard to open if you have long nails, but I have found that if you just use the side of your finger instead of your fingertips then it\'s no problem.  I have recommended this to all new parents!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I have been very happy with this pail.  The greatest thing... regular trash bags!!  The Next greatest thing... 1 handed operation & it takes only a SECOND! Awesome!I have not had any issues with odor.  I change the bag every 5-6 days or so.  If the plunger is not going down, it\'s because you need to change the bag!!The only reason I rated it 4 stars is because changing the bag takes a few minutes.  It can be difficult to open, ALthough, when my daughter gets older and starts getting into things, this will probably be a blessing! :)",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","After using this for 3 years, I still stunned that other people still use the Diaper Genie.  I\'ve even had other Moms tell me that they can\'t smell dirty diapers in my house, even with 2 kids producing them.  If anyone is having trouble, though, try:  a)  wrapping the tabs securely around the diaper; b)  using deodorant trash bags;  and c)  taking dirty diapers straight outside to the trash and using your diaper pail just for wet diapers.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I loved this compared to the genie. It is easier to use and less costly in the long run!!Two thumbs up!!!Now, only if it would spray a freshner on its own. LOL!!!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","We got the Diaper Champ because we thought it was smart to use regular garbage bags and not pay for the diaper Genie refills. BIG MISTAKE! This product does not keep odor in, and when you open it up to put in a new bag in, its all over. My daughter\'s room stinks because of this product and we are in the process of trying to find a REAL odorless diaper pail.",1
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I returned the Diaper G**** that I was given but kept this!  It takes ANY garbage bag (no expensive refills) and is wonderful for controlling odor... that\'s especially important now that our little guy is eating solid food and making more stinky diapers!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","My husband saw this after my first shower and said ""What\'s that thing for?""  He now loves it.  I do too.  Best of all, you don\'t have to buy specific bags, we use the bags from the grocery and they do quite well.  We\'ve bought some air freshener cans and put them in the bottom, because after 8 months of use, it\'s going to smell.  But the room does not carry the smell, only when you\'re on the floor near the genie.  My only issue is that I\'ve broken a nail or two lifting the latch to get the top open.  But it\'s infinitely better than having the smell!!",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","We received the Diaper Champ as a shower gift.  It worked great for the 1st 5 months.  As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.",3
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I highly recommend this item.  It is a must!  I registered for the diaper genie and used it for about a week and couldn\'t stand it.  It broke,the refills are expensive and very hard to install.  Then I got the diaper champ.  What a difference.  Easy to use, just one hand, and no odors.  It uses just your basic tall garbage bags.  So you don\'t have to go out and buy special bags for it.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","My husband and I originally registered for the Diaper Genie, but we changed our minds when we considered that we would only be able to use the Diaper Genie refills.  The Diaper Champ allows you to use regular garbage bags.  Plus it\'s simple to use.  We haven\'t had a problem with odor at all.  It\'s a great product!",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I have a 10 year old daughter and an 8 month old son. There was nothing like this when I had my first child and I really looked into the champ v\'s genie before I brought this and I have to say that I truly LOVE it. I change the bag once a week. My kids have to share a room so if it was smelly I would hear about it. I just spray with a little Lysol at the time of bag change and it is as good as new. Aside form that it is so easy to use with one hand, anyone with a wiggly baby will appreciate that. In fact I love it so much I am going to take one all the way to Australia with me for my niece since she can\'t get them over there. I am the owner of a used baby store in NJ, (I have a champ there too) and this is one of my hottest items, I have several diaper genies there that just do not sell.You will not be sorry you brought the Diaper Champ.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","This is easy, but horribly smelly.  I suggest saving your money and buying a regular trash can.  You will get the same effect, because this doesn\'t do anything special.",2
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","...make sure I tell people about this product. I read the reviews, and at the time, this was the only diaper pail that got any decent reveiws, and now I know why. I bought one for upstairs, and liked it so much I bought one for downstairs. I still have on in my registery hoping someone will get me a third one for my mother in law\'s house. I just use a standard pull string kitchen trash bag, and use it according to the instructions (in other words if you follow the procedure of opening and sinching the bag before removal then you won\'t have a problem) and it works great, good design!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I\'ve given this can as a gift a few times now.  Once to a couple who were on their second child, their response was \'how\'d we survive through the first baby without that can\'.It\'s easy, ordourless, and clean.  What more could new parents on.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I have 2 kids in diapers and the diaper champ has been great for us for 2 1/2 years. Easy to use and change. I love that it uses reg bags. :)",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I registered for this after reading all the reviews and I\'ve been nothing but happy with it. I tried my sister\'s diaper genie and the diaper champ is so much easier to use. The fact that I use the same bags for my kitchen as I do the champ makes it that much easier. I just leave some in the bottom of the champ then I don\'t have to go looking for them. I\'ve never noticed a smell, and although I do agree that it is hard to open, you get used to it and it\'s worth it!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","We have ours in our living room and you can\'t smell a thing.  It is a little difficult to open and it doesn\'t hold a lot of diapers, but overall it works well.",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I have had a great experience with this product so far and have been using it for about 2 months.  I get absolutely no odors in the tiny nursery (even when my daughter had very smelly diarrhea), it\'s easy to use and DOES NOT NEED ANY EXPENSIVE REFILL BAGS (just regular garbage bags) and I would recommend it to anyone.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","The boy is now 1 year old and we have had it since the beginning.  I remember reading a good review about the Diaper Champ and deciding to get it.Honestly, it does a great job.  It does contain the odor to inside the Champ.  I have never noticed a smell in the room, even when it is full.  I have to admit, however, that when you open that bad boy up to empty it, it\'s pretty funky, but what do you expect?If you wrap up your diapers good and empty it before it gets so full that you can\'t squeeze another diaper into it, you will really be happy.  It is very nice to be able to used regular kitchen sized trash bags.  We use the scented bags, which we think helps a lot.Overall, we are very pleased with the Diaper Champ and would recommend it highly! (Only reason I rated it 4out of 5 stars is - nothing\'s perfect, I have a hard time giving out 5 to anything!)",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","This is a great product until your little one starts to play with the handle.  Because the flip-flop handle comes in contact with the dirty diapers when the bag gets full, curious fingers can pick up some nasty germs &amp; even poop if a diaper isn\'t wrapped up into itself (The Grandmas seem to have trouble with that).I have been very happy with the simplicity of the Champ &amp; using regular garbage bags until now.  However, my 14 month old loves to play with it &amp; flip the handle over. I just cringe when I think about what he gets on his hands.Also, the padding in the lid that keeps odor under control seems to have worn out after 1 year.  It came loose, we had to pull it out &amp; there were dirty wipes stuck in there, too. YUCK!Overall, I would recommend the Champ for infants because it\'s VERY easy &amp; you can use 1 hand, but now that I have a toddler I\'m looking for a pail with a locking lid.",3
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","My son is now 5 mo. and overall, I\'m happy with the diaper champ.  I would not recommend wasting money on the types that require special bags. Do not kid yourself that you will have an odor-free diaper pail--I do not think that is possible!  I would rate this as low-odor--I change the bag about once a week.  My complaint, though, is that the plunger-cylinder thing gets stuck because the diapers begin to stack on top of one-another even when the bag is newly-changed.  Also, I do not use the plunger for messy diapers because if the tabs are nor fastened, the tabs get stuck in the plunger thing.  I do not wrap up the messy ones because of the leak factor, so I wind up having to open the lid frequently. The lid is a bit difficult to open, but I like that because when my little guy is more mobile he won\'t be able to open it!",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","The diaper champ is fantastic. You can use regular trash bags which helps reduce the cost of expensive specialty bags. There is absolutely no dirty diaper smell that comes from the Diaper Champ.Absolutely recommend this product.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I love this pail.  You just drop the diaper in the hole, and flip the handle/lid.  Sooooo simple.  It does not smell, and it holds any garbage bags.  With the Diaper Genie, you have to open the lid, shove your arm in the pail, twist 3 times, then wipe off your arm if you know what I mean.  (It also needs special cartridges).  With the Diaper Champ, there is no mess and the diaper is gone in 1 second!  It holds more diapers too.  I definitely recommend it.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I was given the Diaper Geni and after a week of twisting, we bought the Diaper Champ.  This was a great choice.  There is no need to spend extra money on special bags.  We use ordinary supermarket bags.  In order to keep the smell under control, we sprinkle baking soda right at the bottom of the chamber.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I got this pail because I felt it was good that it doesn\'t require you to buy ""their"" garbage bags.  But at the end I still didn\'t use it and just use a regular pail.  Now it\'s sitting in my basement.  The reason I didn\'t use it is because it is hard to open up the can to replace the bag and when you are actually cleaning a baby especially when it\'s #2 it is messy at times where you would probably get it in the pail before you flip the handle to dispose of it.  Well then you  now need to clean the pail as well as the baby.  You don\'t need more work with a child.",1
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","Worst diaper pale ever!!  I\'ve had mine for 2 years now and I am throwing it away as soon as my second Decor arrives.  No matter how many times I clean the ""Chump"" it still stinks.  The diapers and wipes get caught in the drop hole and stuck wet wipes make it stink even worse.  Forget scented trash bags, they won\'t cure the smell of the ""Chump"".  Also, watch out when changing the bag, you may lose a finger if the lid unexpectedly slams shut on you when changing it.  Forget this pale and go for the Decor.",1
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","My sister had a Diaper Genie and it always smelled really bad. She constantly complained about it so I opted to try the Diaper Champ. Boy am I glad! It is so easy to use especially since you can use regular trashbags vs. genie refills and the diaper is gone w/ a flip of a handle!! My son is 9 months old and we have NO SMELL PROBLEMS!!! I don\'t know how some people can complain about smells coming from this thing...it\'s sealed up like Ft. Knox. You never see the inside of the pail until you empty it. The canister pushes the diaper into the trashbag, thus never allowing odors to escape through the pail. I would have to say the only way you may have an odor problem is if you never empty it!!!!!!!!!!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","This is my second child. With my first, I went through the Diaper Genie and hated it ---her nursery always smelled, even though my husband regularly changed that annoying (and expensive refill, $5.00 for each refill adds up faster than you think!) diaper system, he even took it outside and hosed it down with Clorox bleach and sprayed it regularly with Lysol -- to no avail.We also tried the Neat Diaper disposal system, and it\'s pretty and works a little better than the Genie, but it still smells up the room.  The Diaper Champ wins hands down, I for one never had an odor problem and I love the fact that it\'s easy to use and easy to empty, it\'s also easy to dispose of the diaper with one hand (especially when you\'re holding and infant and don\'t want to leave a smelly diaper out of the pail), something I couldn\'t do with neither the Genie not the Neat pail.I highly recommend it!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","The Diperchamp is easy to use, as other people have said. We bought it with our first child, but stopped using it before she turned one. It does not keep the smell in and with only one stinky diper in there my daughter\'s entire room would smell the moment you walked in.I really loved the diperchamp when she was a newborn and her dipers did not smell. Now that we are pregnant with our second child I am not planning on using it again because we did not use it for very long.",3
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I like BabyTrend\'s products. We also have a SnapNGo, and we also seriously considered the Trend High Chair. We\'ve been using the Diaper Champ for almost a year now since our baby was born. I think it does what it advertises and that is that it does a good job of keeping in the odors (we live in a 1 bedroom condo). Pros: easy to use one-hand drop-in mechanism, good odor trapping, can use just about any kind of grocery or plastic bag, convenient handle, and easy to clean. Cons: kind of bulky and heavy even when empty, difficult to open lid for changing. Hint: If using spray cleaning, don\'t spray water into the drop-in hole. The mechanism is not completely watertight and you\'ll trap some water in there. Myself, I\'ve actually done a thorough cleaning only twice. Most times I just spray Lysol inside after changing to a new plastic bag.",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I registered for this product after reading the reviews, and I have to say I was very disappointed.  You are better off just getting a garbage pail with a tight lid.  Not only did my daughter\'s room smell horrible, but I broke three finger nails trying to lift the lid.",2
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","The Diaper Champ doesn\'t smell - how wonderful!  Also, there are no expensive bags to buy for it - you can use regular plastic bags!  Although it seems to fill up quickly(diapers tend to pile up in the middle), this is an absolute must!",4
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I can\'t say enough good things about the Champ.  For my first son we had the Diaper Genie - but it didn\'t do the trick. (too $$ and too difficult to handle).For son #2, I read the reviews and decided to give this one a try.  I still love it!  My son (who is now 3+ years old) is finally getting potty trained, but we still use it to hold the ""nightie night dypes""...  We\'ve been using it for 3+ years and it is still going strong.According to the reviews, I was careful to wrap the diapers before putting them in - which we had to do for the Genie anyway... For the REALLY MESSY ones, I flipped up the lid and placed it right in the bag - which was easy to do.My son still loves to pull the handle and say ""bye-bye"" to what he considers the magic trash can.  For me, the only time I experience an odor is when I change the bags. If the odor inside gets too strong, try using Febreeze -- it even works on the plastic!Strongly MOM Approved!!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","It is so much easier to use than the Diaper Genie (my sister has that) but it does have some problems.  We\'ve used it for a year now, and it never started to smell until the diapers did.  It generally only smells when it\'s really full or you\'re emptying it out.  I wouldn\'t say the smell is such a problem though.  Whenever I empty out the bag (love the fact you can use regular trash bags) I would wipe out the inside and saturate it with Lycol for disinfecting.  The only reason why I am going to have to buy the Diaper Genie now is that my 1 year old loves to put items (sippy cups, toys, etc.) into the hole in the top and flip the handle.  I didn\'t realize he could do this until one day when a sippy cup went missing, and after EXTENSIVE searching I found it inside the diaper pail!  Since then, I have caught him many times trying to do the same thing.  Over all, it\'s a good product.  I think if you smell strong odors coming from the Diaper Champ, it\'s time to clean and empty it!",3
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","My husband and I registered for the Diaper Champ without really knowing much about it.  We picked it because it did not require purchasing refills like the Diaper Genie (which my sister-in-law had and did not really like).  We really like our Diaper Champ because it does not require refills (it uses regular kitchen trash bags)and it keeps out odor completely.  I am recommending this to all my pregnant friends.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","My son is now 18 months old and I have to say that the diaper champ is one of our favorite purchases! We got it when I was pregnant in hopes it would keep our house smelling ok. Well, it does pretty well at that, you still have to change it out everyday, it is poop however!!! But the thing I love most is that I can just use my kroger bags!! With buying diapers and toys, I didn\'t need something else on my list to buy! What a great invention!!!!",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","... than deal with the odor from this pail.  Even changing the whole bag (we tried plastic grocery sacks, tall kitchen bags, even heavy duty garbage bags) every day didn\'t help.  We\'ve moved this product to the garage and purchased a Diaper Genie for the nursery.",2
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I LOVED my Champ for the first year as it was all I expected in ease, cleanliness, odor free with regular bag changes and the economical use of kitchen bags.  Then the liner began to come loose and get stuck in the tumbler and eventually had to be removed altogether making things a bit less odor resistant, but still manageable with regular bag changes, cleanings, airings and sprinklings of baking soda.  The real problem we have now is that no amount of cleaning and deoderizing the Champ after a bag change (about twice a week for us) has managed to eliminate the strong odor that seems to be clinging to the actual pail now.  We\'ve tried a number of disinfectants, deoderizers and air freshners, but they are no match for the offensive odor of the Champ even when clean and empty.  We are so disappointed in the short-term success of this product.  It has been removed from my son\'s room and we are now taking each diaper out individually and looking for another pail.  I am really interested in finding another &quot;use-any-trashbag&quot; style for sake of our finances.  In light of our experience with the Champ, I\'d have to recommend not purchasing this pail unless you are prepared to replace it when it fails to do it\'s no-odor diaper duty in due time.",2
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I have a two-year-old son and I love the Diaper Champ. We initially bought a Diaper Genie and used it for the first 9 months or so, but we really disliked it. It was difficult to use, loud, and then broke on us. We switched the Diaper Champ and love it. It contains our toddler\'s odors just fine. We change the bag once a week and when we change a diaper we make sure to roll it up tightly and use the sticky tabs to close it up.",5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ","I bought this after being gievn a diaper genie as a gift. This is much easier to use. You can use any type of trash bag with this versus the diaper genie where you have to purchase their expensive bags. I highly recommend the diaper champ for storing stinky diapers.",5
