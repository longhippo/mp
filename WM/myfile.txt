Koi fish, also known as Nishikigoi, are a type of carp that are popularly used as ornamental fish in outdoor ponds. They originated from Japan and are selectively bred for their unique colors and patterns. These fish come in various colors like white, black, red, and yellow, and can have distinct patterns like stripes or spots, or even a combination of both. Koi fish are known for their graceful swimming and gentle temperament, which makes them a perfect choice for ornamental fish keeping. It's essential to keep their environment clean and well-maintained, as they can live up to 25 years with proper care, which is quite a long time for a fish.
