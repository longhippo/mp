Koi fish come in a variety of colors, including red, white, black, and yellow, and can have patterns such as spots, stripes, or a combination of both. They are known for their graceful swimming and gentle temperament, and are often kept for their aesthetic beauty. Koi fish require a clean and well-maintained environment to thrive, and can live for up to 25 years with proper care.
